    Tales from Earthsea follows an exiled prince and a wandering wizard as they navigate a fantasy world. While some scenes in the film look absolutely gorgeous, the overall visual quality of the film lacks consistency. The film still looks like a Studio Ghibli film, but it lacks the sense of life which characterizes other films from the famous animation studio.

    In addition, the plot incorporates elements from several of the EarthSea books and suffers as a result. Tales from Earthsea feels at once loaded with plot points and characters while also starved of depth, since there's not enough time to explore each concept. The sprawling plot and shallow character motivations all end up making Tales from Earthsea the weakest Studio Ghibli film by far.
