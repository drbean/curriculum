# Spirited Away

## Summary

A 10-year-old girl has a hard time in the spririt world, working at a bathhouse run by a witch, before returning with her parents to the real world.

## Reception

The film was originally released in Japan on 20 July 2001 by distributor Toho. It became the most successful film in
Japanese history, grossing over $347 million worldwide. The film overtook Titanic (the top-grossing film worldwide at the
time) in the Japanese box office to become the highest-grossing film in Japanese history with a total of ¥30.8
billion. Spirited Away received universal acclaim and is frequently ranked among the greatest animated films ever
made. It won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards, making it the
first (and, to date, only) hand-drawn and non-English-language animated film to win that award. It was the co-recipient of
the Golden Bear at the 2002 Berlin International Film Festival (shared with Bloody Sunday) and is in the top 10 on the
British Film Institute's list of "Top 50 films for children up to the age of 14".


## Plot--Stranded across the river with her parents turned into pigs

Young ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino and her parents are traveling to their new home when her father decides to take a
shortcut. The family's car stops in front of a tunnel leading to what appears to be an abandoned amusement park which
Chihiro's father insists on exploring, despite his daughter's protest. They find a seemingly empty restaurant still stocked
with food, which Chihiro's parents immediately begin to eat. While exploring further, Chihiro finds an exquisite
bathhouse and meets a boy named Haku, who warns her to return across the riverbed before sunset. However, Chihiro
discovers too late that her parents have metamorphosed into pigs, and she is unable to cross the now-flooded river.

## Plot--Working at the bathhouse with note with name

Haku finds Chihiro and has her ask for a job from the bathhouse's boiler-man, Kamaji, a yōkai commanding the
susuwatari. Kamaji refuses to hire her and asks worker Lin to send Chihiro to Yubaba, the witch who runs the
bathhouse. Yubaba tries to frighten Chihiro away, but she persists, so Yubaba gives Chihiro a contract to work for her.
Yubaba takes away her name and renames her Sen (千). While visiting her parents' pigpen, Haku gives Sen a goodbye card she
had with her, and Sen realizes that she had already forgotten her real name. Haku warns her that Yubaba controls people by
taking their names, and that if she forgets hers like he has forgotten his, she will not be able to leave the spirit world.

## Plot--Interaction with No-Face and a stink spirit

Sen faces discrimination from the other workers because she is still a human and not a spirit; only Haku and Lin show
sympathy for her. While working, she invites a silent creature named No-Face inside, believing him to be a customer. A
"stink spirit" arrives as Sen's first customer, and she discovers he is the spirit of a polluted river. In gratitude for
cleaning him, he gives Sen a magic emetic dumpling. Meanwhile, No-Face imitates the gold left behind by the stink
spirit and tempts a worker with gold, then swallows him. He demands food and begins tipping extensively. He swallows
two more workers when they interfere with his conversation with Sen.

## Plot--Haku's troubles with Zeniba

Sen sees paper Shikigami attacking a Japanese dragon and recognizes the dragon as Haku metamorphosed. When a
grievously injured Haku crashes into Yubaba's penthouse, Sen follows him upstairs. A shikigami that stowed away on her back
shapeshifts into Zeniba, Yubaba's twin sister. She mutates Yubaba's son, Boh, into a mouse, creates a decoy Boh, and
mutates Yubaba's harpy into a tiny, flylike bird. Zeniba tells Sen that Haku has stolen a magic golden seal from
her, and warns Sen that it carries a deadly curse. Haku attacks the shikigami, which eliminates Zeniba's hologram. He falls
into the boiler room with Sen, Boh, and the harpy on his back, where Sen feeds him part of the dumpling she had intended to
give her parents, causing him to vomit both the seal and a black slug, which Sen crushes with her foot.

## Plot--Haku's efforts to save Sen

With Haku unconscious, Sen resolves to return the seal and apologize to Zeniba. Sen confronts No-Face, who is now massive,
and feeds him the rest of the dumpling. No-Face follows Sen out of the bathhouse, steadily regurgitating everything he has
eaten. Sen, No-Face, Boh, and the harpy travel to see Zeniba with train tickets given to her by Kamaji. Yubaba orders that
Sen's parents be slaughtered, but Haku reveals that Boh is missing and offers to retrieve him if Yubaba releases Sen and
her parents. Yubaba agrees, but only if Sen can pass a final test.

## Plot--Confronation with Zeniba

Sen, No-Face, Boh, and the harpy meet with Zeniba, who reveals that Sen's love for Haku broke her curse and that Yubaba
used the black slug to take control over Haku. Haku appears at Zeniba's home in his dragon form and flies Sen, Boh, and the
harpy to the bathhouse. No-Face decides to stay behind and become Zeniba's spinner. In mid-flight, Sen recalls falling
years ago into the Kohaku River and being washed safely ashore, correctly guessing Haku's real identity as the spirit of
the Kohaku River (ニギハヤミ コハクヌシ (饒速水琥珀主/饒速水小白主), Nigihayami Kohakunushi, lit. "master of the swift-flowing am
"master of the swift-flowing little white [river]").

## Plot--Yubaba's test and return to the real world

 When they arrive at the bathhouse, Yubaba forces Sen to identify her
parents from among a group of pigs in order to break their curse. After Sen answers correctly that none of the pigs are her
parents, her contract disappears and she is given back her real name. Haku takes her to the now-dry riverbed and vows to
meet her again. Chihiro crosses the riverbed to her restored parents, who do not remember anything after eating at the
restaurant stall. They walk back through the tunnel until they reach their car, now covered in dust and leaves. Before
getting in, Chihiro is shown to still be wearing the hairband No-Face spun for her at Zeniba's home.
