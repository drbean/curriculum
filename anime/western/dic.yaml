    Mayor Goodway: There you go, Chickaletta. There's no such thing as too much protection from the sun. Oh, uh. Silly me. I put my hat on you, Chickaletta.
    Mayor Humdinger: Uh? Oh, no. I'm being attacked by an umbrella.
    Mayor: Oh? Sorry, Mayor Humdinger.
    Ryder: Are you OK, Mayor Humdinger? 
    Mayor Humdinger: I would be more OK, if there were less people here.
    Ryder: The beach is for everyone to enjoy. And Sea Patrol lifeguards are here to keep an eye on all beachgoers--big and small.
    ??: Careful. Don't go out too far.
    Boy: My first tower. Let's make the biggest sandcastle on Adventure Beach.
    Dog: He, he. Maybe we should go and get a bigger bucket.
    Mayor Humdinger: Surf's up.
    Mayor Humdinger: Oh, there it is. The perfect spot to put my towel. Why must people always go to the beach the same day I do.
    Turbot: I do. It's the wonderful weather why else?
    Mayor Humdinger: Wonderful weather, huh? We can change that, can't we kitty? Oh, no. Rain. It's raining. Our day is ruined. We should all go home. You first, Mayor Goodway.
    Man: Rain? Nice try, Mayor Humdinger. You'll just have to learn to enjoy Adventure Beach with all of us here.
    Mayor Humdinger: it wasn't me it was those naughty mischievous kittens. Shame on you, kittens. I'm kidding. You're my little kitty-witties. And that's why you're going to help me with my new plan.
    Boy: What's that?
    Skye: Huh? Goggles, Let's take a look. Ryder, I see a big fin.
    Ryder: That's odd. It kinda looks like a
    Mayor Humdinger: Shark! Oh, no! We should all leave the beach really quickly maybe only leaving behind some ice cream and cool drinks. Oh, shark!
    Mayor Goodway: What? Shark?
    Turbot: A shark? Really?
    Ryder: A shark? That sounds suspicious.
    Turbot: Surely. Sharks don't live around Adventure Beach.
    Ryder: I know but let's play it safe. Chase, use your megaphone to get everyone out of the water then we'll clear the beach just to be sure no one goes in.
    Chase: Hold it. Grrr. Megaphone. Everyone, get out of the water. And clear the beach. The beach is closed.
    Mayor Goodway: There's always tomorrow, chicken of my heart.
    Mayor Humdinger: So sorry. Can't be helped. I'll be right behind you.
    Chase: Ryder, the beach is clear.
    Mayor Humdinger: Of everyone who isn't me, he-he-he.
    Turbot: There surely shouldn't be sharks here. You should investigate.
    Ryder: We will. No job is too big. No pup is too small. Sea Patrol. To the Beach Tower.
    Sea Patrol: Wait. Where's Marshall?
    Marshall: I don't know about you pups, but I just had a ball.
    Chase: Sea Patrol ready for action, Captain Ryder, sir.
    Ryder: We've got a mystery, pups. We need to find out what kind of creature's swimming around Adventure Beach. It looks like a shark but sharks have never been around here before. So for this mission I'll need Skye. We'll need your seaplane and goggles to find it again.
    Skye: Let's take to the sky.
    Ryder: Marshall, I'll need you to use your cannon to launch fishy treats to lure the creature way out to sea.
    Marshall: I'm all fired up.
    Ryder: All right. Sea Patrol is on a roll.

    . . .

    Mayor Humdinger: I thought they'd never leave. Now I can have the beach all to myself. Okay, crew, keep them busy with a wild shark chase while I (yawn) have a beachy catnap.
    Skye: I'm not seeing anything yet. Wait, Ryder, there it is.
    Ryder: keep following it, Skye. Marshall and I are on our way.
    Marshall: I've never been this close to a sh, sh, shark before.
    Ryder: If it is a shark. Whatever it is, let's get it safely away from the beach. Launch these fishy treats through your water cannon.
    Marshall: Water cannon. The shark doesn't want the treats.
    Ryder: That's strange. Try it again.
    Ryder: It's heading back to shore. Skye, make sure no one's left on the beach.
    Skye: Okie-dokie, Ryder.
    Mayor Humdinger: And the prize for best looking sand sculpture goes to me. For me. Uh? Kitties, what are you thinking? Lead them away from the beach and me. And me!
    Marshall: Now it's heading away from the beach? That thing should stop and ask for directions. Uh, oh. It's diving underwater.
    Ryder: We can't lose track of it now. Rocky, ride down in your underwater transport and find that thing. Chase, go with Rocky then skip over to it for a closer look.
    Rocky, Chase: On our way, Ryder. I see it beside us. What kind of shark has wheels?
    Ryder: The kind that's not really a fish.
    Chase: I'm gonna check it out. Lights! Wait. It looks like someone's inside. It's A-choo. A-choo.
    Rocky: the Kitten Catastrophe crew?
    Chase: Yep, them. Ryder, what would the kittens be doing in a mechanical shark.
    Ryder: It must be another one of Mayor Humdinger silly schemes. He's probably around here somewhere.
    Skye: Actually, I found him on the beach.
    Mayor Humdinger: Aargh, I've been spotted.
    Skye: He must have ...
    Chase: Uh, oh.  The water keep rising inside the sub.
    Rocky: Let's get it back up to the surface. What are you kittens doing? Ryder, that shark sub is out of control.
    Ryder: I'll stop it. Zuma, I need some help on the beach. Skye, I think Mayor Humdinger is about to have some company,
    Skye: Mayor Humdinger, the shark is heading right for you.
    Mayor Humdinger: Uh-oh. Stop, kittens! Help!
    Ryder: We're coming, Mayor.
    Mayor Humdinger: Help!
    Rocky: I'm ready, Ryder.
    Mayor Humdinger: Oh, how did my little plan to scare everyone off the beach go so wrong?
    Ryder: Skye, use your seaplane to get Mayor Humdinger out of the way.
    Skye: Gotcha.
    Ryder: Zuma, stop that shark.
    Zuma: Cool. I've never gone fishing on the beach before.
    Boy: Thanks for the towel, Mayor Humdinger.
    Mayor Goodway: it's the least he could do after scaring everyone. Oh and aren't you forgetting someone, Mayor? Thank you for saving our beach day, Ryder.
    Ryder: Whenever you're in trouble just yelp for help.
    Chase: I'm just happy we found a use for the shark sub.
