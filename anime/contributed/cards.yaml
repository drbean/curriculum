      rubric: |+
        Write 2~4 questions about your anime and answer other students' questions about their anime.

        For example, describe the identity, relationships, events and state of mind of a character, and students have to choose one out of the 4 characters.

        The students with most points get 9 for a homework grade. The students who get the fewest points (with a score of 10 or fewer points) get 7 for a homework grade. And those who don't write or answer any questions get zero.

        Finish doing it by midday before the class next week. (Ignore the date appearing on the page. It is wrong.)
