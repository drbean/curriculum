I want to introduce the anime of Doraemon. The story is talking about Sewashi hopes that Doraemon can help his great grandfather Nobita to change his future.

Takeshi,Suneo and Shizuka are Nobita's friends,they are fifth grade students in elementary school.

## Introduction

It’s a story about The Crystal Gems comprise Garnet, Amethyst, Pearl and Steven protect humanity from monsters and other threats on earth.

I love it so much because it's not a typical heroism cartoon, it contains lots of meaning in this story, like friendships, Sexual orientation, Identity Confusion and more.

if I could talk to them, I might ask Garnet some questions about my future.

And I want to ask other people in the class how do they think about this cartoon after my introduction.

## Introduction

This is a funny story about hell, telling the daily life of hell assistant.

Each story is short and can be read apart.

The story is about what might happen in hell.

The author will spoof historical figures and make them look like people who will be around you.

Hoozuki is a subordinate of
Enma (閻魔王えんまおう)
, responsible for working rigorously.

Hoozuki often roast other characters.

I think this is why this comic is so interesting.
