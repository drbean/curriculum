# Osamu Tezuka (手塚 治虫)

## Bio

[Osamu Tezuka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Tezuka) (Japanese: 手塚 治虫, born 手塚 治, Hepburn: Tezuka Osamu, 3 November 1928 – 9 February 1989) was a Japanese manga artist, cartoonist, and animator.

His prolific output, pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres earned him such titles as "the Father of Manga", "the godfather of manga" and "the god of manga".

He is often considered the Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney, and Disney served as a major inspiration during Tezuka's formative years.

Though this title reflects the quality of his early manga works for children and animations, it also sells short the significant influence of his later, more literary, [gekiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gekiga) works

# Alakazam the Great (西遊記)

## Original meaning

## Reception in America

*Overrated* (The opposite word is "underrated*)

Despite a large marketing budget, heavy editing and heavy promotion, the film was unsuccessful in America.

 It was included as one of the choices in [The Fifty Worst Films of All 
 Time](https://www.listchallenges.com/the-fifty-worst-films-of-all-time), and 
 is the only animated film featured in the book, something that later became 
 ironic with the popularity of anime in the United States.
