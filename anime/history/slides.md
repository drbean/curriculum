# Osamu Tezuka (手塚 治虫)

## Bio

[Osamu Tezuka](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osamu_Tezuka) (Japanese: 手塚 治虫, born 手塚 治, Hepburn: Tezuka Osamu, 3 November 1928 – 9 February 1989) was a Japanese manga artist, cartoonist, and animator.

His prolific output, pioneering techniques, and innovative redefinitions of genres earned him such titles as "the Father of Manga", "the godfather of manga" and "the god of manga".

He is often considered the Japanese equivalent to Walt Disney, and Disney served as a major inspiration during Tezuka's formative years.

Though this title reflects the quality of his early manga works for children and animations, it also sells short the significant influence of his later, more literary, [gekiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gekiga) works

# Alakazam the Great (西遊記)

## Original meaning

Alakazam is an incantation or magic word along the lines of Abrakadabra

## Wikipedia article

## Reception in America

*Overrated* (The opposite word is "underrated*)

Despite a large marketing budget, heavy editing and heavy promotion, the film was unsuccessful in America.

 It was included as one of the choices in [The Fifty Worst Films of All 
 Time](https://www.listchallenges.com/the-fifty-worst-films-of-all-time), and 
 is the only animated film featured in the book, something that later became 
 ironic with the popularity of anime in the United States.

## summary

From https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/black-jack-the-two-doctors-of-darkness

When a bomb goes off in a nearby building, the unlicensed surgeon Black Jack secures a release from jail in return for helping out at the scene. A few months later, the group that planted the bomb lure Black Jack to a mysterious island that used to be a military base. When he arrives, he is stunned to find that his patients are all infected with a new type of anthrax, but what he also discovers is that he is not the only doctor to have been called. Dr Kiriko - a renegade doctor known as Death Incarnate due to his willingness to kill his patients on request - is also there. With their differing views on medicine, Black Jack and Kiriko clash, but with both their lives at stake for knowing too much, the pair will have to work together if they want to get out of this alive.
