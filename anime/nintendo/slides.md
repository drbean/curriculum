# Luigi

## From www.mariowiki.com

- [https://www.mariowiki.com/Luigi](https://www.mariowiki.com/Luigi)


## Creation and development

 After observing the two-player competitive and cooperative gameplay of the arcade game Joust, Miyamoto wished to incorporate a similar style of gameplay into his own game. Miyamoto's answer was Luigi, a younger twin brother to Mario, with whom he could compete or cooperate.

## Name

 While Mario's name was base on Mario Segale, Luigi's name is said to have been based on a popular pizzeria near Nintendo of America's headquarters, named Mario & Luigi's; coincidentally, his name was also noted to be similar to the Japanese word 「類似」 (ruiji), meaning "similar", possibly a reference to how Luigi was originally a simple palette swap of Mario.

## Reception

With the 2-player mode in mind, Nintendo and publishing companies such as Atari gave Luigi immediate publicity, making him the star and center of attention in many advertisements for the game.
