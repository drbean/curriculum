      rubric: |+
        Last week, we worked out who A, B and C were by asking questions based on a scenario Dr Bean wrote about Spirited Away. Now write a scenario about Mario, Luigi and Gooigi describing the [Mario & Luigi - Super Anime Brothers-jvupK5lHOqU.mp4 clip](http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/anime/clip/Mario & Luigi - Super Anime Brothers-jvupK5lHOqU.mp4)

        (If you want to write about different characters and a different story, that is OK).

        Use the questions you wrote last week for homework as a guide.

        Don't name the character you describe on each card. Name them on the other cards. But try to describe how the character on the card is related to the other characters on the other cards. For example, if you have Gooigi on the A card, don't use the name Gooigi, but say he plays Number 2 to a Number 2. Say he pushes Mario (not the real Mario) into the lava. (That's right, isn't it. Wait, I don't think it's right. Can you check?)

        The aim is to create a scenario where students can ask questions and work out who A, B and C are. Also write 2 True/False questions that students have to answer.

        This is a difficult assignment, but I was impressed by the quality of your questions last week and I am looking forward to seeing how you handle it. Message me if you have any questions.

        Check the Spirited Away A, B and C cards that Dr Bean wrote.

        And check the True/False questions
