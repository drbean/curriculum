        ## Talking about an anime

        In the midterm and final exams, I will ask you to talk with me and another person about an anime

        For homework this week,

        - choose an anime
        - write down the name of the anime as subject
        - write down the link (if there is one) or a few keywords (if no link) in the message
        - speak for 30 seconds about it

                - Say your name
                - Say who are the characters
                - Say what they do
                - Say why it is interesting
                - Say questions you might ask the characters
                - Say questions you might ask other people in this class
                - Perhaps you could relate (tell) the story you hear

        You can do this alone. You don't have to have a conversation.

        Upload the file by clicking the video camera button next to the microphone button. Remember to add the extension, .mp3, .m4a, etc to the end of the file you upload, so Dr Bean can listen to the file.

        Listen to what the other students say about their anime. And *message* me if you have problems.

        In class, next week, I will ask you to present the anime to the class. So this homework is preparation for that presentation.

        ## Talking to Dr Bean about anime

        This is a cooperative-competitive activity

        With a partner, show/introduce an anime and have a 3-person conversation about it. Ask your partner and Dr Bean questions.

        Dr Bean decides who the winner is based on:

        * who speaks most
        * who is most *articulate* (talks well) about their anime
        * who asks/answer most questions
        * who is interesting/humorous/grammatical
        * who is most knowledgeable about anime
        * who is good at conversation

        * The winner gets 3 points
        * The loser gets 2 points

        ## Find a partner to cooperate/compete with talking to Dr Bean

        Who are you happy both beating or losing to?
