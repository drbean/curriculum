## Classwork activity--Wero's activity

Wero, following the jigsaw activity last week, proposed a different activity.

In her activity, each person gets a card with the traits/characteristics of a 
character from a given anime and reads out one of the traits. If you think you 
have the card with the same character on it, you can ask for it, by saying the 
name of the character. The aim is to pair up your cards.
