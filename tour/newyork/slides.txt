## Dictation

## Tour guide

Not a touristy location

*Any* location overseas.

5 pictures, 3 sentences about each picture.

You also have to make a google map.

# Exam Week 13

## What the tourists do {.allowframebreaks}

4 tour groups of 15 (-1) tourists from Blue, Green, Pink and White countries

Wear comfortable shoes, because you will be walking around the classroom 15 times in 2 hours.

- You fly to the country you are visiting.
- a tour guide comes to meet you at the first location and speaks for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
- You follow the guide (walk) to the second, third, fourth, and fifth location, around the room and listen to another 30-60 second talk.
- You tip the guide, 4, 6 or 7 beans. The guide leaves, taking the flag.
- You fly home.

Repeat.


## What the tour guide does {.allowframebreaks}

One person (a tour guide) from another country tells the others about his/her walk overseas. The places on the walk must be connected. It must be possible to walk from one place to all the other places.

Tourguides, you do not leave your country after the tour. Tour guides do not move clockwise to join the next group. They just go back to join their fellow countrymen/women and particpate in the next tour.

The others decide what grade to give her, 4, 6, or 7 beans. Each person has only 81 beans to award 14 tour guides.

The group will decide the grade on the basis of the interest of the talk and her/his performance as a tour guide.

## Managing the beans

Before the tourist guide leaves, the tourists individually decide how much to "tip" her/him by giving 4, 6, or 7. Each tourist, try to keep equal numbers of 4, 6 and 7 bean notes, so that you don't run out of any one note, and so that you can give the first through last tour guide the number of beans they are entitled to.

## Deciding how many beans {.allowframebreaks}

Criteria

1. Could you understand what he/she said?
2. Was what they said interesting?
3. Were they well prepared to be a tour guide?
4. Did they speak about 5 places connected by a walk?
5. Did they say 3 things about each place?
6. How long did they speak?
7. What was the reaction of the other tourists?
8. Did tourists ask questions?

## Distribution of 3-, 4-, and 5-bean tips {.allowframebreaks}

Try to give equal numbers of 3, 4 and 5 beans.

- 4 beans if you can't understand and it isn't interesting and they don't speak very long.
- 6 beans if you think they did a good job and you understood what they said.
- 7 beans if you wished you could do as well as they did, because they satisfied all the 8 criteria.

## Responsibilities {.allowframebreaks}

The next tour guide from a country will be chosen at random.

For the Front Left tour group from the Yellow country, the tour guides will come from the Front Right Group, in the Blue country.

For the Front Right tour group from the Blue country, the tour guides will come from the Back Right Group, in the Pink country.

For the Back Left tour group from the White country, the tour guides will come from the Front Left Group, in the Yellow country.


## Example {.allowframebreaks}

Take the Front Left, Yellow tour group

They will wear yellow badges. Make sure the paper clip does not tear your clothes

1. Let's suppose Ula is their first tour guide.
2. The Yellow tour group flies (in the same Front Left spot).
3. Ula appears, takes the Yellow flag and introduces the first place (in the same Front Left spot).
4. She leads the group to the Front Right spot (the second place introduced).
5. In turn the group proceed to the Back Right spot and Back Left spot (for the third and fourth place introduced).
6. The Yellow group returns to the Front Left spot (and the fifth and last place is introduced).
7. The Yellow group pays/tips Ula.
8. The Yellow group flies home (in the same Front Left spot). And Ula puts down the flag, and returns to her country/group, where she becomes a tourist again.

## Penalties

- If you are tardy, you lose 20 percent.
- If you are a [straggler ](http://www.google.com.tw/search?q=%22+straggler%22&num=100&gws_rd=ssl&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X)
  , you lose 5 percent each time.
- Keep your badge on at all times, or lose 10 percent.
- If Dr Bean has to check you for some other reason, like in the wrong group, you lose 10 percent each time.

## Bean economy II {.allowframebreaks}

Each of the 14 tourists in the group of 15 has 81 beans, in the form of

- 4 four-bean notes,
- 5 six-bean notes and
- 5 seven-bean notes.

Check you have all these 14 notes. {.allowframebreaks}

This is good for an average of 81 beans for each tourist guide.

## Possible results {.allowframebreaks}

If every tourist gives the tourguide 4 beans, the guide gets 56 beans, a failing grade.

If every tourist gives the tourguide 6 beans, the guide gets 84 beans, an average grade.

If every tourist gives the tourguide 7 beans, the guide gets 98 beans, a very good grade.

You must give each tour guide one note, either 4, 6, or 7 beans. You have 14 notes for 14 tour guides.

Even if the last tourguide didn't do a good job, if you have only the 7-bean note left, you must give her the 7-bean note.

The tourguide will count the number of notes he/she gets.

Try to keep a track of how many 4-, 6- and 7-bean tips you are giving. This can only be a rough estimate. Don't worry about that.

Dr Bean will ask you after the -2 C tour guides and -4 C tour guides have got their tips.

## Procedure

You will be the tourguide in random order.

I think we will try to give each guide 30 seconds in each location. We may have to speed up at the end. You don't have to talk for 30 seconds if you don't like. You can answer questions, if there are any.

If someone is absent, tell me. I will give a responsible tourist in the tour group those beans. When it is that absent person's turn to speak, everyone in the group must give me a 4-bean note.

If they are tardy, they lose 20 percent. They get back the beans that the responsible tourist hasn't used.

If they arrive after it is their turn to speak they get 14 4-bean notes I collected.

If you do not or cannot give your tourguide a note, tell me. We will make up the lost note, but your grade goes down 5 percent.
That is if you lose beans, your grade goes down 5 percent.

Keep the notes fastened with the paper clip. You have to give them up. I want the notes in the paper clip when you give them up to be counted.

Put one note into your World/Country's [collection plate](https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1318&bih=740&q=collection+plate&oq=collection+plate&gs_l=img.3..0i19l5j0i30i19l2j0i5i30i19l3.1225.4257.0.4702.16.16.0.0.0.0.68.566.16.16.0....0...1.1.64.img..0.16.564.YPIH0f_Pgz0#imgrc=_), actually [collection bag](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1198&bih=673&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=church+collection+bags&oq=church+collection+bag&gs_l=img.3.0.0i19j0i8i30i19.43118.45068.0.50012.7.7.0.0.0.0.43.214.7.7.0....0...1.1.64.img..3.4.131.wnvRnWLA2rs)
