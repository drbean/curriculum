    Boyle: So, Jodi, What's up. Thanks for coming on the show.

    Ettenberg: Hi, Nathaniel. Thanks for having me.

    Boyle: Awesome. So where are you coming from right now.

    Ettenberg: Right now I am in Saigon in Vietnam, the southern, southern side of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City, as it is now known, but still called Saigon, while you're in the city. In the city, people still refer to it as such.

     And I've been here for a few months, since January. I went last year and just really fell in love with the food and how the culture really does center around food here. So I decided to make it my winter home again this year.

    Boyle: Amazing. OK. So I kind of gave a general overview of who you are. But I want you to tell us about yourself, and how you got started traveling.

    Ettenberg: Sure. I think it's common to assume that I was a corporate lawyer and I burnt out and I just fled and started traveling instead. Which isn't out of the .. makes sense, given the facts. But actually, what happened was that I had really wanted to do the Trans-Siberian trains as a month-long trip or a longer journey. And I saw a documentary about them when I was younger. And I just really, over the years, sort of kept that with me. And when I got a job offer to work in New York as a lawyer, I decided I would save up as much as I could during the .. time that I was working there. I'm from Montreal, so salaries were quite a bit higher in New York, and it seemed like a great way to get started on this dream I had.

      Um, when I had left 2008, my plan was really just to do one year of travel. I never quit to be a travel writer or to write about food. What I started my blog for was just to keep my mother updated about my life, to be honest. She has always been really supportive, but I thought that the visual component would be helpful as well in terms of what she could feel that she was a part of. And so I started it up. Legal Nomads made sense. I was with another lawyer, who was my opposing counsel, actually, on a deal. And we set off in April of 2008. We split ways pretty quickly because we had different desires of where we wanted to go and we're still really good friends. But I kept up with the site. She didn't love writing. And the rest really just fell into place over the years. It became more and more involved in food and how food is a great tool to learn about a place and wrote about it more. My readers seemed to jibe with that as well. And the site has grown and grown by itself over the last six years. April first will be six years. And it's got about a million people a year, according to my Wordpress annual report. Over a million for 2013.

    Boyle: Wow, that's really .. Congratulations.

      Ettenberg. Thank you. Yeh. I was surprised. I don't pay that much attention to the stats. And so when I got the annual .. It's a click here for your shiny annual report. And it's in the form of an infographic. And I clicked, and I was, "Wait. What?" (Laughs) This is lovely.
        
    Boyle: (Laughs) Cool. I think it's great that the Trans-Siberian is what inspired you to get out there and travel ..

    The walk will take in lanes, alleyways, little streets, arcades, the cafe society and all the fascinating shops. Before we start, you can download a copy of the map from www.visitvictoria.com.au. Or you can pick up a copy from the Melbourne Visitor Center at Federation Square, where the walk begins.

    Now while you're doing this walk, no doubt you're going to want to stop at different times and have a closer look at some of Melbourne's great little spots. So, feel free, at any time, to press Pause, and then continue on with the podcast when you're ready to move on.
    
    Today we're starting our walk from outside the Melbourne Visitor Center at Federation Square. If you're standing outside the Melbourne Visitor Center and looking towards the nearest intersection of Flinders and Swanson Streets, you'll see the magnificent Flinders Street Station on one corner, Y and J's or Young and Jackson's on the north-west corner and St Paul's Cathedral on the north-east corner.

    So, let's begin our walk by crossing from Federation Square to a traditional Melbourne meeting place, 'Under the Clocks' at Flinders Street Station. Flinders Street Railway Station is the oldest city station in Australia. It was built in 1854. Now since that time, countless people from the city and the bush have met under these clocks making it a special place for many. Perhaps that's why when the original analog clocks were replaced for a short time with digital ones, there was a public outcry. Many of the analog clocks were quickly returned.

    Now let's wait for the lights and then cross over Flinders Street and turn left or westward along Flinders Street. From this angle, you'll be able to appreciate how long Flinders Street Station really is. At 700 meters, it's Australia's longest railway station as well.

    We're heading down now to Degraves Street, where we'll turn right. From this angle you can get a good view of how long Flinders Street Station really is. At 700 meters, it's Australia's longest railway platform. We're now going head down to Degraves Street, where we'll turn right.

    The walk trail we're going to follow today will take you to a hidden source of food, plenty of drink and shopping in the heart of Melbourne that's enjoyed by many, but not really known to all. It's a part of a Melbourne that is a pedestrian's paradise. And our small and historic arcades are home to more than 260 specialist shops. We're going to uncover a unique part of Melbourne City that can only be enjoyed by foot.

    Now for those of you who haven't visited our laneways before, you might be imagining the normal rubbish bins and graffiti that you might see in the laneways of other cities around the world. Well, I can tell you you're in for a real treat today, because in our laneways you won't see any of that. They're all filled with music and diners and the aromas of wonderful cafes and restaurants that spill out into the laneways, turning them into delightful courtyards full of people and free of cars.

    Now whether you're a serious shopper or just a stroller, exploring the city arcades, will always be rewarding. Melbourne's little laneways began life as a rear access to properties facing the major streets. Many were later roofed as arcades to provide refuge from the weather and crowds and to provide more space for the shops. Today, many laneways have been reborn and hum to the rhythm of the daily city life.  Others are still waiting to be discovered.

    We're now in Degraves Street where William Degraves' steam flourmill pumped away in the 1850s. Today, though, now the only steam you'll see here is the steam from espresso machines. Degraves Street is a mecca for Melbourne's cafe society. Now this place is where caffeine and the truly chic meet. Maybe you can have a coffee at the Degraves Espresso Bar, and check out the recycled cinema seats and benches from the former magistrates court. If your tastes are more whole food than whole bean, why don't you check out the healthy delights at the organic shop or juice bar?

    At the end of Degraves Street, on the other side of Flinders Lane, you can see the Majorca Building ...
