## Have/get something done

Passive form of the second verb.

The "someone" who is doing something for you isn't important. It's what they did for you which is important.


# Recording Homework

## Recording 9 of 12--Something that changed your life

## Uploading files

If you can't find your partner, do it with someone else, and upload the file. And send a message to Dr Bean. And/or add a submission comment when you upload the file.

Each person in your group can upload a file, if you can't find your partner and you do it with someone else.

Remember to add the extension, .mp3, .m4a, etc to the end of the file you upload, so Dr Bean can listen to the file.

Upload a file under your own name, if you want to be sure Dr Bean won't make a mistake with your grade.
