## Transcript

It was this big, huge thing wrapped in aluminum foil. I take off this layer of aluminum foil, and there's more aluminum foil, and like 30 layers of foil and plastic wrap, and this, that and the other.

 I've seen my Mema bake this for people whose mothers have died. It's something that she takes to those who grieve,

And then here I am, and I'm in a foreign country, in a hostile environment, and that same pound cake is now sitting in front of me.

I gave every one in my 12-man team a slice. I ate mine first — and I cried. I think that if we had dined in her kitchen the moment that it cooled and she took the towels off of it, it could not have been as fresh as it was there on that mountainside.

And, for that one moment, I felt loved, even though I was lonely. The pound cake was clean, even though I was so dirty. It was cold, and that pound cake warmed me.

It was just like Mema was there.
