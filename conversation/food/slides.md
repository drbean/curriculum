## Transcript

It was this big, huge thing wrapped in aluminum foil. I take off this layer of aluminum foil, and there's more aluminum foil, and like 30 layers of foil and plastic wrap, and this, that and the other.

 I've seen my Mema bake this for people whose mothers have died. It's something that she takes to those who grieve,

And then here I am, and I'm in a foreign country, in a hostile environment, and that same pound cake is now sitting in front of me.

I gave every one in my 12-man team a slice. I ate mine first — and I cried. I think that if we had dined in her kitchen the moment that it cooled and she took the towels off of it, it could not have been as fresh as it was there on that mountainside.

And, for that one moment, I felt loved, even though I was lonely. The pound cake was clean, even though I was so dirty. It was cold, and that pound cake warmed me.

It was just like Mema was there.

# Talking about eating

## Ideas about eating contests

Read/listen to an account of an eating competition. Dr Bean likes to eat, but can't understand why people would want to try and eat more  than other people and to eat so much that it hurts and you want to stop. Dr Bean thinks it is not good for their bodies. What do you think?

## Eating habits (diets) questions

- Talk about what you have eaten today.
- What is the most unhealthy eating habit you can think of?
- What do people need to eat more of?
- Do you usually eat in a healthy way?
- What are some different types of diets you have heard of?
- Do you think your parents ate healthier food at your age than you do? How about your grandparents?
- Do you eat a lot of small portions or a few large portions of food each day?
- Do you think people from your country usually eat in a healthy way?
- What are some things about your eating habits you want to change?
- Do you think that organic food is much better than normal food or are they about the same?
- Why is organic food so much more expensive?
- What is traditional food in your country like? Is it eaten in a healthy way?
- Do you think that a person’s eating habits affect how long they will live?
- Do you eat to live, or live to eat?

## Difference between "wish" and "hope"

Let's forget about uses like

"When you wish upon a star, makes no difference who you are."

and

"We wish you a Merry Xmas."

Wishing is hoping for magic to happen, but it doesn't and won't happen. Magic doesn't exist.

Say, "I wish I could ..", not "I wish I can .."

## Difference between "wish" and "hope". More about ..

You can say, "Hope you have a good day," but you can't say, "Wish you have a good day."

"I wish you would .. " is used to complain about something. You don't expect the person you're talking to do what you want them to do.

"I wish it would stop raining," means you don't expect it to stop raining. You don't think there is a chance it will stop raining.

"I hope it stops raining this afternoon," means you think there is a chance it will stop raining.
