        \begin{description}
        \item [Background] Much of the US used to belong to Mexico, but the US took it in wars. There are about 7 million Mexicans in the US who are there illegally. Many Americans don't like to hear Spanish being spoken.
        \item [Assimilation] Mexicans do become more similar to Anglo-Americans after 2-3 generations, but because of the way ordinary Americans discriminate against them, they may resist this process of assimilation.
        \item [Thanksgiving] Mexicans in the US celebrate Thanksgiving the same way as ordinary Americans do, even eating the same kind of Thanksgiving food, eg turkey.

        \begin{description}
        \item [Date] The fourth Thursday in November in the US. The second Monday in October in Canada.
        \item [Character] A secular (non-religious) festival to give thanks for the harvest. In fact, similar festivals in Europe have a Christian or pagan nature.
        \item [Activities] No gift-giving, but there is eating, family reunions, taking a nap, and watching football on TV.
        \item [History] Most people (but not Canadians) think the ceremony started in a feast the first Pilgrims had with the Indians in New England, in thanks for helping them survive in the new land.
