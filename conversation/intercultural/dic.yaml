    Egerton: Speaking of the Southern Historical Association, were you the first black member of it?
    Franklin: That I don't know, John, I really don't know, maybe not. I was the first to be on the program.
    Egerton: Do you know when that was? Was that in Memphis?
    Franklin: No, no, it was in November, 1949 in Williamsburg, in Phi Beta Kappa Hall.
    Egerton: You were on the program?
    Franklin: Yes.
    Egerton: That was the first time a black person had been on the program of the Association?
    Franklin: That's right.
    Egerton: When did you first have membership in it, do you recall?
    Franklin: No, I really don't.
    Egerton: Early, in the '40s?
    Franklin: Yes, I was already a member. I don't remember how far back I went. I always believed, you see, that I ought to belong to my professional organizations. So I did go back to, I would say, the early '40s. If I had the money to join then, I probably did join in the early '40s. Then Vann Woodward came to me in '47 or '48, and he said, "John Hope, if I get to be chairman of the program committee of the Southern and if it meets in a fairly respectable [Laughter] place, would you be on the program?" I said, "Well, yeah." So he became chairman of the program committee, and it was going to meet in Williamsburg which was supposed to be pretty good, you know, [Laughter] better than some places. Then he announced to the program committee what he had done, and they like to have died.
    Egerton: They didn't like this too much.
    Franklin: They didn't like that at all! At all!
    Egerton: but he stuck by it.
    Franklin: "What have you done to us? What have you done to us?" They raised hell, and then it's, you know, "How you going to arragne it?" But all through this long shot song and dance about "Where's he going to stay? Where's he going to eat? Where's he going to be on the platform? Will there be white people? Will he be on a platform that is higher than them, and therefore he'll be talking down to the white people in the audience?" All these things. "Who's going to be on the program with him?" You know, the session where you have two papers. Bell Wiley volunteered to be on the program with me, and Henry Commager volunteered to preside.
    Egerton: So he introduced you?
    Franklin: You couldn't get in that place. It was on the ground floor of Phi Beta Kappa Hall. [Laughter] People even looking in the windows on the side. And it passed without a hitch.
    Egerton: Did you get a good reception?
    Franklin: Got a good reception. Mrs. Lyon Tyler--that's the only question that I can remember--she said, "I don't understand how we can sit here and hear him use the term, Civil War, when he should call it the War Between the States." And everybody broke out laughing. [Laughter] Everybody just laughed at her. You know who she is? Mrs. Lyon Tyler is the daughter-in-law of President John Tyler. She goes back that far. It seems that President John Tyler married when he was real old and had a baby. Then his son married when he was real old and had [a son] Lyon G. Tyler, who later was, I guess, maybe president of William and Mary. One of these very reactionary-type historians anyway.
    Egerton: Lyon?
    Franklin: Lyon G. Tyler, that's a well known name is southern history.
    Egerton: That's outrageous. Well, what did they do about the other things? Where did you stay?
    Franklin: Well, Douglas Adair [inaudible], we had this all fixed up. But Vann let them squirm. He said, "Well, you know, he's very resourceful. He might bring his pup tent and K-rations." [Laughter]
    Egerton: He held their feet to the fire, huh?
    Egerton: You did not attend the banquets?
    Franklin: I don't think I did. I'm sure I didn't.
    Egerton: Gosh, '49, man. Imagine that. God.
    Egerton: You were president in 1970?
    Franklin: I think so. I've been president of all those other major historical societies. I always liked the fact that it was the Southern, the first big organization that named me president.

  - An outsider's view of Thanksgiving
  - conversation

    Jose: I didn't know about Thanksgiving. From the little English that we knew, my brother and I knew that we were not going to have class that day. And everybody was saying, Thanksgiving, but we understood it as "San-Giving" so we figure out, Oh, it must be some patron saint of the United States. And my brother said, Well, this must be a real important saint because they're going to have these dinners and so on. So we went over and looked at a missal in Spanish and we kept looking and we didn't see any saints marked for that particular day.

      So we asked our friend Jack Johnson, who was our neighbor, great guy, to explain to my dad, who spoke English, this idea of Thanksgiving. My dad said that Jack had told him that they celebrated with pumpkin pie. So we went out and we got this pumpkin pie and it was frozen and we had the sharpest knife there trying to cut it--we couldn't cut it--and finally we did it. My dad had a piece and I had a piece and we thought it was just horrible. The next day we talked to Jack Johnson and Jack, he said, No, you're supposed to put the pie in the oven. You know? And bake it. From then on pumpkin pie is a favorite of mine at Thanksgiving.

    Teresita: After it's cooked.

    Jose: Yeah, because it's cooked.

   Theresa: Many times when I look back on your upbringing, if I had to do it again, a couple of things I would have changed,
   Stephanie: What would you do differently?
   Theresa: I would be a little more compromising. Remember some boy gave you a necklace?
   Stephanie: And you made me go back to school the next day and give him back the locket.
   Theresa: Okay, I was taught from my mom, do not accept presents from strangers, because if you accept presents from them, you have to repay them; it's a debt you have to carry to your grave. So things like that, I'd go back and be a little more understanding. I might ask to go swap it out for something cheaper.
   Most of your friends are Vietnamese too, right? And, um, I don't know if you ever compare, if your mommy is tougher than mine?
   Stephanie: I don't even know where to start with that. Oh, when you're 12 and your whole world revolves around who got to sleep over at whoever's house, it's not fun to say, 'Oh no, I can't do that.' 
   Theresa: I know, a lot of times I am living in this country trying to acculturate, but at the same time, I want to preserve the Asian culture. I want to keep the family together, And sometimes when I look back I ... I do realize that I was a little bit too tough.
   Stephanie: I wouldn't say that I resent you in any way for that. I think I learned a very strong sense of right and wrong, and working hard.
   Theresa: I know many, many times I'm very proud of you-- but I just don't say it. And Daddy gets on my case all the time: 'You don't say it, you don't say it,' and I would tell him, 'But she knows I feel it.' I don't know if you do know or not,
   Stephanie: I'm glad that you're proud of me, because most of the time I feel like I'm a disappointment.
   Theresa: No, you are not! I am just one of those old Asian moms. We never say we love you. We expect you to see it through our actions. But I'm learning, I'm learning. When I go away from this life, I want you to remember my love for you, that's all. I don't care for anything else.

    A: You're making a lot of noise there with the noodles. Why do you slurp them?


    B: This is how all Koreans eat. I'm eating politely. Am I disturbing you?


    A: No, I don't mind. It used to disturb me before, but I got used to it.


    B: We do it because the noodles are hot. If you slurp them, they are cooler.

    A: Come and have dinner tonight at 9pm.


    B: 9pm? It will be difficult for me to get up next morning. I'm an early sleeper.
    \[Later, at 1am in the morning\]
    B: Sorry, I'm about to fall asleep. I must go. How can you stay up so late?


    A: Don't go. The night is young. You can sleep after lunch, in the afternoon. That's what everyone does in Spain.
