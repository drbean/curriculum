# Recording

## Recording 12 of 12--Feelings about going abroad

Ask your partner questions like those on p32, eg "What country would you like to live in?"

Answer your partner's questions with a noun phrase containing a relative clause, as in Grammar Focus on p31, eg, "One thing I'd feel worried about living in Japan is money. Everything is so expensive."

30 seconds. Each person must ask his/her questions and answer 2 questions from their partner.

This is the 12th of 12 conversations. They are worth 40 percent of your grade.

Identify yourself clearly. Say, "I'm John."

## Uploading files

If you can't find your partner, do it with someone else, and upload the file. And send a message to Dr Bean. And/or add a submission comment when you upload the file.

Each person in your group can upload a file, if you can't find your partner and you do it with someone else.

Remember to add the extension, .mp3, .m4a, etc to the end of the file you upload, so Dr Bean can listen to the file.

Upload a file under your own name, if you want to be sure Dr Bean won't make a mistake with your grade.

## Recording 6 of 12--Feelings about going abroad

Tell your partner about a custom like those in Interactions p 118, or any other custom which you think is interesting.

Ask your partner a questions about his/her custom, eg "Why do you think that?", or "Could you get used to it?"

30 seconds. Each person must ask his/her questions and answer 2 questions from their partner.

This is the 6th of 12 conversations. They are worth 40 percent of your grade.

## Exam 4 of 6--Conversation

Remember the conversation exam on Thursday. Don't be more than 15 minutes late! Or your score will only be 1 for talking with Dr Bean.

This is the 4th of 6 exams. It is equal in importance to the Mid-term and final exams.

## 3 simultaneous exams

* talking with Dr Bean
* writing questions about Keiko and moving
* pair dictation

## talking with Dr Bean

With an opponent,

ask Dr Bean a question about a custom in Taiwan or another place.

When you talk to him, he will be thinking about:

* your interest in a custom in another culture
* your knowledge about that custom
* comparisons and contrasts with a second custom
* your ability to learn about other cultures
* your ideas about the good and bad things about the custom

Dr Bean will decide the winner, who gets 5, and the loser, who gets 4.

Don't leave approaching Dr Bean to the last minute. Otherwise you both only get 3.
There are many students and not much time. You may not have a chance to talk to him with your opponent.

## writing questions about the Carla, Nate and Shauna in Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Spain

On the website, write as many questions using words from the list.

	If you write one or two questions you get less than 1.
	If you write 20 or more, you get a good score.
	The person who writes most (grammatical) questions gets 5.

## pair dictation

You and your partner you will have 2 cards like

- [http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/topics/dic_diet_1.pdf ](http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/topics/dic_diet_1.pdf)
- [http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/intercultural/quiz_franklin_0.pdf ](http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/intercultural/quiz_franklin_0.pdf)

But they will be about Carla, Nate and Shauna talking with a local person in Saudi Arabia, South Korea or Spain.

## pair dictation instructions

* read the lines from the conversation to your partner
* DON'T WRITE ANYTHING ON THE CONVERSATION CARDS
* write your name, group and card number on the card
* write the answers to the questions on the quiz card
* Don't look at your partner's card
* use English to ask your partner for help

## use English 

Say, eg

* "Read line 5 again."
* "Slowly."

## The examiners' work

The examiners:

* Will find you and your partner. (You *must* do the exam with the person in your group.)
* Get you to sit down and give you a card
* Make you write your names, your groups and the card number on the card
* Say, "Go"
* Stop you from lifting your card from the desk
* Stop you from looking at each other's card
* Collect your cards, making sure you wrote your name, group and card number

## Notes for the examiners

I want you to do the pair dictation exam too, but not the conversation with Dr Bean. 

After you've finished, put all the cards in order from 01 to 53 and A before B, like 

	* 01 A, 01 B, 02 A, 02 B .. 53 A, 53 B.

## Students without partners

* If one person doesn't have a partner, put them with someone else. You choose the new partner.
* Cross out the name of the person who is not there and write the name of the person who takes their place. This person's group changes also. 
Keep the cards of those 2 students together.
* Tell students who take someone else's place that it's OK to do the exam twice. If someone has 2 scores, they get the higher score.
