## Transcript

FP Jr: Since I was around nine or ten, I would come sometimes with you to help you on campus.

FP Sr: I remember I told you that one day, you were going to go here to Stanford.

FP Jr: That really stuck with me. And when I also would go with mom to clean houses, I saw the hard work and that set the example for me. So because of you, I applied.

FP Sr: And then, you told us that you had been accepted but you were worried that, “Financially dad, I don’t know if I can go because I don’t have the money.” And I told you, “Your mom and I will do whatever needs to be done.”

FP Jr: When I was on campus, I knew that on Mondays and Fridays you would clean the fountains around 1:15pm, so I would make sure that I would walk that way to go and see you, and check in to see how things were going.

FP Sr: It was a routine, and my friends there at work, they always would tell me, “Oh I saw your son over here, or I’ve seen him over there.” It was like I had extra eyes watching over you.

FP Jr: Do you remember what I told you my graduation day?

FP Sr: Of course. You said, “Dad, this diploma is for you. And I still joke, because we have the diploma at home on the wall, and I go, “No, you can’t take that with you. You told me that was mine, I’m keeping it.”

FP Jr: Reflecting about your life, do you have any regrets?

FP Sr: Yes, I do have one major regret. I was actually going to college to be a teacher, but I had financial problems, so I had to leave school and get a full-time job. And sometimes, I still think about being able to be a teacher, but I feel to me that it’s too late. And to see my son go to Stanford, it’s like a little bit of me there. It gives me a lot of pride.

Ask your partner questions like those on p32, eg "What country would you like to live in?"

## Exam 4 of 6--Conversation

Remember the conversation exam on Thursday. Don't be more than 15 minutes late! Or your score will only be 1 for talking with Dr Bean.

This is the 4th of 6 exams. It is equal in importance to the Mid-term and final exams.

## 3 simultaneous exams

* talking with Dr Bean
* writing questions about Keiko and moving
* pair dictation

## talking with Dr Bean

With an opponent,

ask Dr Bean a question about a custom in Taiwan or another place.

When you talk to him, he will be thinking about:

* your interest in a custom in another culture
* your knowledge about that custom
* comparisons and contrasts with a second custom
* your ability to learn about other cultures
* your ideas about the good and bad things about the custom

Dr Bean will decide the winner, who gets 5, and the loser, who gets 4.

Don't leave approaching Dr Bean to the last minute. Otherwise you both only get 3.
There are many students and not much time. You may not have a chance to talk to him with your opponent.

## writing questions about the Carla, Nate and Shauna in Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Spain

On the website, write as many questions using words from the list.

	If you write one or two questions you get less than 1.
	If you write 20 or more, you get a good score.
	The person who writes most (grammatical) questions gets 5.

## pair dictation

You and your partner you will have 2 cards like

- [http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/topics/dic_diet_1.pdf ](http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/topics/dic_diet_1.pdf)
- [http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/intercultural/quiz_franklin_0.pdf ](http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/intercultural/quiz_franklin_0.pdf)

But they will be about Carla, Nate and Shauna talking with a local person in Saudi Arabia, South Korea or Spain.

## pair dictation instructions

* read the lines from the conversation to your partner
* DON'T WRITE ANYTHING ON THE CONVERSATION CARDS
* write your name, group and card number on the card
* write the answers to the questions on the quiz card
* Don't look at your partner's card
* use English to ask your partner for help

## use English 

Say, eg

* "Read line 5 again."
* "Slowly."

## The examiners' work

The examiners:

* Will find you and your partner. (You *must* do the exam with the person in your group.)
* Get you to sit down and give you a card
* Make you write your names, your groups and the card number on the card
* Say, "Go"
* Stop you from lifting your card from the desk
* Stop you from looking at each other's card
* Collect your cards, making sure you wrote your name, group and card number

## Notes for the examiners

I want you to do the pair dictation exam too, but not the conversation with Dr Bean. 

After you've finished, put all the cards in order from 01 to 53 and A before B, like 

	* 01 A, 01 B, 02 A, 02 B .. 53 A, 53 B.

## Students without partners

* If one person doesn't have a partner, put them with someone else. You choose the new partner.
* Cross out the name of the person who is not there and write the name of the person who takes their place. This person's group changes also. 
Keep the cards of those 2 students together.
* Tell students who take someone else's place that it's OK to do the exam twice. If someone has 2 scores, they get the higher score.
