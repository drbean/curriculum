## Recording 4 of 16--Conversation

Ask your partner from the first 4 weeks the question you asked Dr Bean last week. Answer your partner's question.

Change the question if it doesn't make sense. For example, if you asked "How many children do you have", ask "How many children do you want to have?"

This is the 4th of of 14 conversation. They are worth 40 percent of your grade.

Identify yourself. Say, "I'm John."

If you can't find your partner, do it with someone else. And send a message to Dr Bean.

Remember to add the extension, .mp3, .m4a, etc to the end of the file you upload, so Dr Bean can listen to the file.
