        \item [Psychological/social support] Therapy for all the patient's family may help. Training also helps patients get jobs, learn skills and manage their lives.
        \item [Hospitalization] Long-term stays in hospital used to be common, but are now rare. Some people may be held in hospital against their will.
        \item [Expectations] Most patients don't get much better. Most smoke or take drugs. Most don't lead healthy lifestyles and die earlier than normal.

      B: You were mentally retarded and very fearful of people. Your family couldn't handle you. They had Sig admit you to Rockland in 1960 when you were 8. You made friends with Ralph. Both of you got out of Rockland in 1970. You hadn't seen Ralph in 40 years.

        \item [Split] This money split the movement into `consumer' groups, which took medication willingly and got more money, and `survivor' groups, which rejected psychiatry and didn't get as much money. The `survivors' are against forcing patients to take medication.
