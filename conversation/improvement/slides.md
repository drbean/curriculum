# Have/get something done

## Have/get someone (to) do something

"Get" originally means "receive", the opposite of "give".

But here it means "make someone do something for me/you".

## Have/get something done

Passive form of the second verb.

The "someone" who is doing something for you isn't important. It's what they did for you which is important.


# Recording Homework

## Recording 7 of 12--Something I want to get done

Record a conversation about something you want done.

Look at p 58. Which of these things do you want someone to do for you. Why?

Ask your partner questions.

30 seconds. Each person must ask his/her questions and answer 2 questions from their partner.

This is the 7th of 12 conversations. They are worth 40 percent of your grade.

Identify yourself clearly. Say, "I'm John."

## Uploading files

If you can't find your partner, do it with someone else, and upload the file. And send a message to Dr Bean. And/or add a submission comment when you upload the file.

Each person in your group can upload a file, if you can't find your partner and you do it with someone else.

Remember to add the extension, .mp3, .m4a, etc to the end of the file you upload, so Dr Bean can listen to the file.

Upload a file under your own name, if you want to be sure Dr Bean won't make a mistake with your grade.
