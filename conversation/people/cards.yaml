      A: Branson started you because he thought the other airlines were not doing a good job. The other airlines tried to put you out of business, so Branson sold Virgin Records to save you. Now, you are still not making much money, so perhaps Northern Rock loans you money.
      B: Branson wanted to have a bank, so he bought you cheaply after you had lost a lot of money. Now, you are doing OK and perhaps you loan Virgin Atlantic money, because it is not doing very well. You have no connection with Virgin Records. Branson sold it.
