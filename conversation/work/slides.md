Studying finance at Rutgers University, she was treated     meanly and unfairly by a teacher, and at her first job interview, the boss    used offensive language with her. She also had to make tough decisions about  her children, her marriage and her career. She wanted to give 100 percent to  all three. But that was not possible.

She says that things were not good in the 1970's when she    was young. But she says men still think the same. The only difference is that they are more careful about how they express themselves, ie they are more     subtle.
