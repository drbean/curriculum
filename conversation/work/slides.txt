Angelo Bruno, 60, _____(1) more than 30 years as a _____(2) worker in New York City. He and his _____(3), Eddie Nieves, _____(4) more than 14 tons of garbage from the city _____(5) each day.  But the two men, who _____(6) together for nearly 10 years, did more than just _____(7) the trash.  "Everybody would _____(8) come out just to talk to you," Nieves, 55, said to Bruno when they _____(9) a StoryCorps booth recently.

People along their _____(10) in Manhattan's West Village would _____(11) the two and _____(12) them coffee or breakfast, Bruno said. And _____(13) on their route would kiss them.  "The younger _____(14) would ask me, 'How did you _____(15) that?' It's just a _____(16) good morning, have a nice weekend. Hey, you look _____(17) today," Bruno said. "I _____(18) do 14 tons of garbage — I can't _____19() a baby carriage off a _____(20) and carry it down?

"When I first came on the job, there was one old timer ... I remember Gordy Flow his name was. One day, he stopped the truck. He tells me, 'Angelo, you look down this block first. See all the sidewalks are all crowded up with garbage?' So I think nothing of it. My father always told me to respect my elders. I get to the end of the block, and he stops me again. 'Get out of the truck, look back. Nice and clean right? People could walk on the sidewalk. Guys can make deliveries. Be proud of yourself,' " Bruno explained.

## "I _____(18) do 14 tons of garbage — I can't _____19() a baby carriage off a _____(20) and carry it down?

Does this mean:

A: I can't do this.
B: Of course, I can do this.


## I never thought my last day would be so emotional for me. 

- Dr Bean: I never thought (that) teaching could be so interesting.
- Dr Bean: I never thought (that) I would be in 台灣 so long.

Used to express surprise about something that happened/is happening

= I didn't expect teaching to be so interesting.
= I didn't expect to be in 台灣 for such a long time.

## I think I could have done another 31 years.

Bruno didn't (couldn't) do another 31 years, because he's retired.

Dr Bean: I could have been famous/a contender.

He is not a [contender.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wz6YMrJt7xk)

Used to

- brag/boast about something which you didn't do, or to 
- regret something that didn't happen

I could have taught at NTU, rather than NUU.

# Ron Kroenke--The piano tuner

## The interest of Ron Kroenke's story

### Doing the work you do for no payment

Ron Kroenke was tuning the piano at the nursing home and not getting paid for it.

Dr Bean doesn't like talking to people in English in the street.

### Things which make you feel good or not good on the job

Ron Kroenke felt bad when one woman was _ungrateful_ for the work he was doing. And he felt good when another woman _appreciated_ his dedication.

Dr Bean likes it when students speak English, are enthusiastic, and enjoy his activities. He doesn't like it when they speak Chinese, are not interested, and don't do what he wants them to do.

## Haven't you ever heard if isn't broke, don't fix it?

- ["If it ain't broke, don't fix it" ](http://www.google.com.tw/search?q=%22If+it+ain%27t+broke,+don%27t+fix+it%22&num=100&gws_rd=ssl&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X)

To criticize someone for doing something;

- Haven't you ever heard, Too many cooks spoil the broth, when ...
- Haven't you ever heard, A stitch in time saves nine, when ...

## Well, how nice, you know, they have no idea that I'm going to bore them to sleep with my tuning. 

Well, how nice. They have no idea that I'm going to bore them to death with my tuning. 

Nice, or not nice?

Well, how nice. He (Dr Bean) has no idea that there's no school today, (having ridden up the hill in wind and rain).

Thus, an unpleasant surprise.
