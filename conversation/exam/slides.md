# Exam

## Exam 2 of 6--Conversation

Remember the conversation exam on Thursday. Don't be more than 15 minutes late! Or your score will only be 1 for talking with Dr Bean.

This is the 2nd of 6 exams. It is equal in importance to the Mid-term and final exams.

To prepare, do the homework before Tuesday 10am. Ask a partner the question you will ask Dr Bean about working together on Thursday.

## 3 simultaneous exams

* talking with Dr Bean
* writing questions about Keiko and moving
* pair dictation

## talking with Dr Bean

With an opponent,

* ask Dr Bean a question about cooperating with other people:

	*asking/being asked for help,
	*gifts,
	* apologies,
	* phone calls,
	* favors,
	* invitations,
	* compliments
	* or
	* complaints

Dr Bean will decide the winner, who gets 5, and the loser, who gets 4.

Don't leave approaching Dr Bean to the last minute. Otherwise you both only get 3.
There are many students and not much time. You may not have a chance to talk to him with your opponent.

## writing questions about Keiko and moving

On the website, write as many questions using words from the list.

If you write one or two questions you get less than 1.
If you write 20 or more, you get a good score.
The person who writes most (grammatical) questions gets 5.

## pair dictation

You and your partner you will have 2 cards like
[http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/topics/dic_diet_1.pdf ](http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/topics/dic_diet_1.pdf)

But they will be about 2 people, making requests.

## pair dictation instructions

* read the lines from the conversation to your partner
* write the words your partner tells you in the blank
* Don't show your card to your partner
* Don't look at your partner's card
* use English to ask your partner for help

## use English 

Say, eg

* "Read line 5 again."
* "How do you spell word 30?"
* "How do you spell 'summer'?"
* "S-U-M-M .."
* "Slowly."

## The examiners' work

The examiners:

* Will find you and your partner. (You *must* do the exam with the person in your group.)
* Get you to sit down and give you a card
* Make you write your names and your groups on the card
* Say, "Go"
* Stop you from lifting your card from the desk
* Stop you from looking at each other's card
* Collect your cards, making sure you wrote your name and group

## Notes for the examiners

I want you to do the pair dictation exam too, but not the conversation with Dr Bean. 

After you've finished, put all the cards in order from 01 to 53 and A before B, like 

	* 01 A, 01 B, 02 A, 02 B .. 53 A, 53 B.

## Students without partners

* If one person doesn't have a partner, put them with someone else. You choose the new partner.
* Cross out the name of the person who is not there and write the name of the person who takes their place. This person's group changes also. 
Keep the cards of those 2 students together.
* Tell students who take someone else's place that it's OK to do the exam twice. If someone has 2 scores, they get the higher score.
