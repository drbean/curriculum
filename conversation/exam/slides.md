# Exam

## Exam 1 of 6--Conversation

Remember the conversation exam on Thursday. Don't be more than 15 minutes late! Or your score will only be 1 for talking with Dr Bean.

This is the first of 6 exams. It is equal in importance to the Mid-term and final exams.

To prepare, do the homework before Monday 7pm. Ask a partner the question you will ask Dr Bean about work on Thursday.

## 3 simultaneous exams

* talking with Dr Bean
* pair dictation
* writing questions about Mark and Tracy

## talking with Dr Bean

With an opponent,

* ask Dr Bean a question about work
* have a conversation
* listen to your opponent's conversation

Dr Bean will decide the winner, who gets 5, and the loser, who gets 4.

Don't leave approaching Dr Bean to the last minute. Otherwise you both only get 3.
There are many students and not much time. You may not have a chance to talk to him with your opponent.

## pair dictation

You and your partner you will have 2 cards like

But they will be about 2 people, Mark and Tracy talking about summer jobs.

* read the lines from the conversation to your partner
* write the words your partner tells you in the blank
* use English to ask your partner for help

Say, eg

* "Read line 5 again."
* "How do you spell word 30?"
* "S-U-M-M .."
* "Slowly."

## writing questions about Mark and Tracy

On the website, write as many questions using words from the list.

If you write one or two questions you get less than 1.
If you write 20 or more, you get a good score.
The person who writes most (grammatical) questions gets 5.
