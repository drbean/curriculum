# Recording

## Recording 2 of 12--Feelings about the environment

Ask your partner questions about issues like those on p 44, 46, eg "What environmental issues do you feel strongly about?"

30 seconds. Each person must ask his/her questions and answer 2 questions from their partner.

This is the 2nd of 12 conversations. They are worth 40 percent of your grade.

Identify yourself clearly. Say, "I'm John."

## Uploading files

If you can't find your partner, do it with someone else, and upload the file. And send a message to Dr Bean. And/or add a submission comment when you upload the file.

Each person in your group can upload a file, if you can't find your partner and you do it with someone else.

Remember to add the extension, .mp3, .m4a, etc to the end of the file you upload, so Dr Bean can listen to the file.

Upload a file under your own name, if you want to be sure Dr Bean won't make a mistake with your grade.
