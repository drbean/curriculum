    A: Wait, don’t throw that out!
    B: Why not, Morgan?
    A: Recycle it. Paper and plastic can be used again.
    B: I'll let the garbage men sort it out. I have too much to worry about without worrying about trash, Morgan.
    A: No. If you do that your trash will end up in landfills. That's land that could be used by farmers to grow food and other things.
    B: Give me a break, Morgan! Now, we have to start worrying about how farmers are going to make a living? No! No!
    A: In many places the dumping areas have already been filled up!
    B: Well, find new ones! There's a lot of land in the mountains that's not being used, Morgan!
    A: No one wants trash buried in their neighborhood, but it has to go somewhere!
    B: So what’s the solution, Morgan?
    A: There is no easy solution.

    A: I love my new computer, Dalton, but I don’t know what to do with my old one.
    B: Well, it's a huge problem, disposing of electronic devices and other appliances.
    A: Do you want my old computer, Dalton? It still runs OK.
    B: No, I have a new laptop. Do you want my old phone?
    A: No, I have an iPhone 8. But I have an old refrigerator, Dalton. I could give it to you if you want it.
    B: Many people don’t know what to do with their old phones and computers. There are dangerous chemicals in these products.
    A: A good idea is to pass it on to a friend. And there are many people who don't have money and would welcome an old computer.
    B: The problem is, with all the new technology these days, there’s more e-waste than ever before.
    A: So what are we supposed to do, Dalton?
    B: The solution is to dispose of it responsibly.

    A: You know, you always hear about air pollution, but not many people are aware of the problem of water pollution.
    B: Water pollution? Everyone knows about water pollution, Kendall. You mean in the oceans? Like turtles and plastic?
    A: Well that's one kind of water pollution. But I'm talking about polluted drinking water.
    B: Everyone knows about polluted drinking water in Taiwan, Kendall! No one drinks tap water.
    A: OK, it's a problem in Taiwan, but it’s a problem in almost every major city in the world, too.
    B: Really? I hear people drink tap water in Japan, Kendall. Do you know anything about that.
    A: Water in Japan comes from rivers and lakes, which are polluted by farms and factories.
    B: So why do they drink the water, Kendall? Why does tap water in Japan taste clean?
    A: The water most Japanese drink is treated, it’s still not a hundred percent pure.
    B: So what’s the solution?
    A: Well, it’s a complicated problem.
