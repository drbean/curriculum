## Sivers analyzes how a movement starts

Sivers talks about how to start a movement. First, a leader needs the guts to stand out and be ridiculed. But, the first follower has a crucial role, showing everyone how to follow. The leader needs to embrace the first follower as an equal, because the first follower is what transforms a lone nut into a leader. With a second follower, it isn't two nuts. Three is a crowd and a crowd is news. With five more followers, we have momentum and a tipping point. We have a movement.

If you _____(23) about starting a movement, you _____(24) have the courage to _____(25) a nut. The _____(26) guy gets all the _____(27), but the first follower _____(28) the lone nut into a _____(29).

## Sivers analyzes how a movement develops

As more people join in, it's less risky. Those sitting on the fence now won't stand out and be ridiculed, if they join. They will be part of the in-crowd, if they hurry. Finally, those that prefer to stick with the crowd will join in, because they will be ridiculed for not joining in. If you care about starting a movement, you should have the courage to follow a nut. The shirtless guy gets all the credit, but the first follower transforms the lone nut into a leader.
