# Recording Homework

## Recording 6 of 12--Something else I learned

Now record a new conversation about learning to do something else, something you did not talk about last time.

Can your partner ride a bike? Swim? Play a musical instrument? Cook?

Ask your partner questions like those on p54, eg "How did you learn it?"

30 seconds. Each person must ask his/her questions and answer 2 questions from their partner.

This is the 6th of 12 conversations. They are worth 40 percent of your grade.

Identify yourself clearly. Say, "I'm John."

## Uploading files

If you can't find your partner, do it with someone else, and upload the file. And send a message to Dr Bean. And/or add a submission comment when you upload the file.

Each person in your group can upload a file, if you can't find your partner and you do it with someone else.

Remember to add the extension, .mp3, .m4a, etc to the end of the file you upload, so Dr Bean can listen to the file.

Upload a file under your own name, if you want to be sure Dr Bean won't make a mistake with your grade.
