## Recording 7 of 16--Conversation

Ask your partner which things on p18 you like or dislike being asked to do. Choose some other thing if you want.

30 seconds. Each person must say what he/she thinks.

This is the 7th of 14 conversations. They are worth 40 percent of your grade.

Identify yourself clearly. Say, "I'm John."

## Uploading files

If you can't find your partner, do it with someone else, and upload the file. And send a message to Dr Bean. And/or add a submission comment when you upload the file.

Each person in your group can upload a file, if you can't find your partner and you do it with someone else.

Remember to add the extension, .mp3, .m4a, etc to the end of the file you upload, so Dr Bean can listen to the file.
