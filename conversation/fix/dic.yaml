    A: Hello. I was wondering if you could change the lightbulb out front. It keeps flickering, and it’s going to go out.


    B: I’ll take care of it later, Mrs Won. I’m really busy right now, and besides, it’s still light outside.


    A: But it’ll be dark when I get home tonight.


    B: I’d love to help, but somebody borrowed my ladder, Mrs Won.


    A: Well, you know, I have a chair! And if you give me a lightbulb, I can ask my son to change it. OK?


    B: Oh! OK. Here . . . take a lightbulb from one of my lamps so you know it works.


    A: Thank you!

    A: Uh, excuse me.


    B: Yeah?
    

    A: Uh, I was wondering if you could do something about my next-door neighbor’s dog? It’s been barking and keeping me up all night.


    B: Mr Two, dogs bark. That’s what they do.


    A: Yes, but they don’t have to bark all night. This is three nights in a row.


    B: Have you seen the size of that dog, Mr Two? You want me to go up there? That dog could hurt me!


    A: Well, I need my sleep!


    B: Look, look. I tell you what. I’ll call your neighbor and ask if he can keep his dog quiet


    A: OK. Thank you!

    A: Hello.


    B: Hello, Mrs Threet.


    A: I have a problem.


    B: What is it now, Mrs Threet?


    A: It’s my kitchen window. It’s jammed shut. I can’t open it anymore.


    B: I’m not sure how I can help you.


    A: Well, it needs to be opened. Can you try?


    B: That’s not really part of my job, Mrs Threet. Maybe you could try putting some vegetable oil on it.


    A: I don’t think so. I’ll call my cousin George to come over to take a look at it. He’s a weightlifter.
