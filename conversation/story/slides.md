# Storycorps

## Talking about a storycorps story

In the midterm and final exams, I will ask you to talk about a recording on 

- [http://storycorps.org](http://storycorps.org)
- [https://www.npr.org/series/4516989/storycorps](https://www.npr.org/series/4516989/storycorps)

For homework,
- choose a story
- write down the link
- speak for 30 seconds about the recording

	- Say your name
	- Say who is talking
	- Say what they are talking about
	- Say why it is interesting
	- Say questions you might ask the people in the recording
	- Say questions you might ask other people in this class
	- Say how something in your life was different (or the same)
	- Perhaps you could relate (tell) the story you hear

You can do this alone. You don't have to have a conversation.

Remember to add the extension, .mp3, .m4a, etc to the end of the file you upload, so Dr Bean can listen to the file.

In class, next week, I will ask you to present the recording to the class.

# Recording

## Recording 5 of 14--Conversation

Tell your partner the story you told Dr Bean.

For example, "I can remember in kindergarten, the teachers once had the kids play music in an orchestra. I played the triangle, but after some other kids conducted the orchestra, a teacher asked me to be conductor. I can't remember, but I don't think the teachers thought I was a good conductor."

30 seconds. Each person must say tell his/her story.

Ask your partner a question about his/her story.

This is the 5th of 14 conversations. They are worth 40 percent of your grade.

Identify yourself clearly. Say, "I'm John."

## Uploading files

If you can't find your partner, do it with someone else, and upload the file. And send a message to Dr Bean. And/or add a submission comment when you upload the file.

Each person in your group can upload a file, if you can't find your partner and you do it with someone else.

Remember to add the extension, .mp3, .m4a, etc to the end of the file you upload, so Dr Bean can listen to the file.

Upload a file under your own name, if you want to be sure Dr Bean won't make a mistake with your grade.

## Recording 10 of 14--Conversation

Tell your new partner the same story you told your old partner. Use at least 3 sentences.

Or tell a different story.

For example, "I was cycling in heavy rain, when a car hit me from behind. Because it was very heavy rain, I was cycling in the middle of the lane, and I guess the driver didn't see me. I wasn't injured and he paid for the repairs to my bicycle."
