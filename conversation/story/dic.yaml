    A: (Kicks the ball into the goal.)
    B: Oh, no! Another goal for you!
    A: What's the score? I've forgotten.
    B: We have two goals. And you have three.
    A: Hey, look. Isn't that a bull. What's it doing on the field?
    B: It's a bull. It's coming this way. Run that way!
    A: Kick the ball away! Perhaps the ball is making it angry.
    A: (Runs one way.)
    B: (Runs the other way.)
    A: Look! It's leaving the field.
    B: Oh, good. We can start again.

    A: Hey, Matt. You're lucky to be alive and well.
    B: Yes. I had the ride of my life. Never again!
    A: What were you doing before the typhoon?
    B: I was talking to my grandmother and watching TV.
    A: What happened when the typhoon hit?
    B: It ripped the walls off and sucked me into the air.
    A: You apparently flew 1,300 feet before it dropped you.
    B: Yes. I fell into a field. It hurt!
    A: No broken bones or other damage?
    B: Just some cuts and scratches.

    A: We're taking you in! You're a car thief!
    B: Catch me if you can! (Drives off)
    A: Follow that car!
    B: (Drives very quickly)
    A: I'm losing control of the car! We're heading into the river!
    B: Oh. The police car crashed into the river. What should I do?
    A: Help! Hey! The car thief has come back to rescue us!
    B: Are you OK? Let me pull you out of the river.
    A: (Later) Thanks for rescuing us from the river!
    B: Thanks for dropping the charges against me.
