        ## Talking about a storycorps story

        In the midterm and final exams, I will ask you to talk about a recording on 

        - [http://storycorps.org](http://storycorps.org)
        - [https://www.npr.org/series/4516989/storycorps](https://www.npr.org/series/4516989/storycorps)

        For homework this week,

        - choose a story
        - write down the link
        - speak for 30 seconds about the recording

                - Say your name
                - Say who is talking
                - Say what they are talking about
                - Say why it is interesting
                - Say questions you might ask the people in the recording
                - Say questions you might ask other people in this class
                - Say how something in your life was different (or the same)
                - Perhaps you could relate (tell) the story you hear

        You can do this alone. You don't have to have a conversation.

        Remember to add the extension, .mp3, .m4a, etc to the end of the file you upload, so Dr Bean can listen to the file.

        Listen to the stories other students chose.

        In class, next week, I will ask you to present the recording to the class.
