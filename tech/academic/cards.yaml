      A: I installed Moodle on the computer in the Fall Semester and studied how to set it up. I then uploaded quizzes to the server. Students answered the quizzes by writing their answers using the Moodle website. Moodle provided many ways to set up the quizzes.
      B: I was interested in using the computer to run quizzes. I had previously used paper cards, one card per group, but it took time to grade the quizzes. I wanted to see if I could run the quizzes the same way using the computer.
      C: There are problems in using the computer to run group quizzes and other new teaching techniques, as my experience shows. A lot of time and computer knowledge are needed to make the computer do new things. I will continue to study Moodle to make it do group quizzes.
      D: I could only run quizzes for individual students. I wasn't able to work out how to run group quizzes. Moodle is a very big app and I didn't understand how Moodle worked so I wasn't able to improve it to run group quizzes.
