      A: I installed Moodle on the computer in the Fall Semester and studied how to set it up. I then uploaded quizzes to the server. Students answered the quizzes by writing their answers using the Moodle website. Moodle provided many ways to set up the quizzes.
      B: I was interested in using the computer to run quizzes. I had previously used paper cards, one card per group, but it took time to grade the quizzes. I wanted to see if I could run the quizzes the same way using the computer.
      C: There are problems in using the computer to run group quizzes and other new teaching techniques, as my experience shows. A lot of time and computer knowledge are needed to make the computer do new things. I will continue to study Moodle to make it do group quizzes.
      D: I could only run quizzes for individual students. I wasn't able to work out how to run group quizzes. Moodle is a very big app and I didn't understand how Moodle worked so I wasn't able to improve it to run group quizzes.

      A: It appears that loud, violent music produces the most rice. We intend to study if loud noises also produces good results. However, we need to be careful about our conclusions. Perhaps the heavy metal field had the best soil, and best fertilizer.
      B: "The field that was exposed to heavy metal produced the most rice: 1 kilogram per square meter. The Mozart field produced 600 grams per square meter and the no-music field produced 400 grams per square meter."
      C: There have been reports that playing music to plants helps them grow. The purpose of this experiment is to see if this is true and to see if different kinds of music have different results.
      D: "Three different fields of rice were exposed to three different kinds of music: no music, Mozart, and heavy metal, over loudspeakers 12 hours a day."

      A: The TIMSS scores of Taiwan and the United States from 2003 to 2015 were compared for math and science in 4th and 8th grades.
      B: According to the TIMSS results, Taiwan has a better education system than the US, at least in terms of exam scores. However there are other criteria, like creativity or teamwork, in which the US may be superior. So, it is hard to say what "better" means.
      C: Taiwan was in the top 10 in all years in both math and science and in both 4th and 8th grade. The US was only in the top 10 in some years, and never ahead of Taiwan.
      D: People say the US education system is better than Taiwan's but the countries are very different so it is difficult to compare the 2 systems. One way is to look at scores on international tests comparing students in different countries.

      A: Only weak evidence of flossing effectiveness was found in the studies. The dental students and children who flossed did not have better teeth than those who did not floss.
      B: Dental floss (thread) is used to clean the spaces between teeth, but dentists are not sure that flossing is better than just teeth brushing alone, because it takes a lot of time to do it properly. 
      C: 12 studies of flossing were compared to see if people who floss have healthy teeth. Some studies were of dental students and children.
      D: The ineffectiveness of flossing is surprising. Most people aren't willing to do it well. The dentist needs to consider whether a patient is willing to take the time to floss. The dentist should tell the patient about other methods to keep teeth healthy.
