About the Speaking Section
The third section of the TOEFL iBT® test is the Speaking section.

In this section, you will be asked to speak on a variety of topics that draw on personal experience, campus-based situations, and academic materials. 

The Speaking section takes about 17 minutes to complete, and there are 4 questions. 

Questions 1 is the Independent Speaking question, which is on a topic that is familiar to you. 

Questions 2 through 4 are the Integrated Speaking questions. For these questions, you have to use more than one skill. Some questions require you to read, listen, and then speak, while others require you to listen and then speak. When you listen, you will hear accents from North America, and you may also hear accents from the U.K., New Zealand or Australia.

For all Speaking questions, you use a headset with a microphone to record your responses. Your responses are sent to ETS to be scored by certified raters. The Speaking section score will be on a scale from 0-30. 

You will learn more details about the Speaking section this week through a series of videos about the different Speaking question types.

Timing and Approach

The TOEFL® test will take you through each of the 4 Speaking questions, giving you a certain amount of time to prepare and speak for each one. Depending on the question type, you will have between 15 and 30 seconds to prepare your Speaking response. It's important that you use this time to decide what you want to say, but do not try to write down your full response; you won't have time to write everything down, and raters expect to hear you speaking naturally, not reading from a script. Then, you will have 45 or 60 seconds to actually speak your response. These times will be displayed with a countdown clock on your computer screen so that you will know how much time you have left to prepare and to speak. The following table shows how much time you have to prepare and speak your response for each question type. 

Question Type	Preparation Time	Response Time
1	15 seconds	45 seconds
2	30 seconds	60 seconds
3	30 seconds	60 seconds
4	20 seconds	60 seconds
Remember, your response should only provide content that the question asks of you. For questions 1, try to keep things simple and focused on the main message you want to share. Then, support your main message with examples or details. For questions 2 through 4, don't try to repeat everything you heard in a conversation or lecture. You should expect the Speaking section to last for about a total of 17 minutes. 

How the Speaking Section is Scored

Do Pronunciation and Accent Affect Scoring?

TOEFL® raters are accustomed to hearing various accents from around the world. The important thing is to have clear pronunciation so your responses can be understood. As long as your speech is comprehensible, it is possible to receive a high score with an accent. If you have concerns about your pronunciation, you can refer to the Resources section of Unit 4.9 for useful tips about checking and improving your pronunciation.


Speaking Rubrics


The Speaking tasks are scored on a scale of 0-4 using a rubric, or scoring guide. The rubric describes the characteristics of a spoken response at each score level so that the rater can assign the appropriate score.

The rubrics for the Independent questions and the Integrated questions are similar. Both evaluate your speaking in terms of delivery, language use, and topic development. Some of the details vary because of the differences in the question types.

You can view the Speaking rubrics here: Speaking Rubrics(opens new window)
https://www.ets.org/s/toefl/pdf/toefl_speaking_rubrics.pdf

 These are exactly the same rubrics that ETS raters use when scoring speaking tasks. There is not a "public version" and a "rater version" of the rubric, like some other tests have.

If you are working with an English teacher, you can ask him or her to help evaluate your practice responses using these rubrics.

About Making Mistakes


It's important to remember that even native speakers make mistakes when they speak. While speaking your responses on the TOEFL® test, you can make occasional errors in pronunciation, grammar and vocabulary and still get a high score. A high score does not mean a response is perfect, but it does mean that it is intelligible. Familiarize yourself with the contents of the rubrics to learn what raters are looking for in a high-level response. In the rubrics, you can see that there is some room for mistakes/errors in delivery, language use, and topic development even at the highest score band, as long as your response is still clear and you include all the information that is relevant to the question. If you make a mistake, don't let it worry you too much. Quickly correct the mistake if you are able to, and continue speaking so that you can give a full response.

Speaking Practice Test Directions

This section measures your ability to speak in English about a variety of topics.

There are four questions in this practice test. For each question, you will be given a short time to prepare your response. Then you will answer the question as completely as possible in the time indicated for that question. The specific time durations for each question are listed in unit 4.2 of this course.

This practice test uses an automated scoring tool that allows you to record your responses and submit them for electronic scoring by ETS. You will be prompted to give this tool permission to access your microphone before recording any responses. See additional system requirements below.

For each question, after you read and listen to all parts of the question, start your preparation time by selecting BEGIN below the microphone icon. When your preparation time is complete, select RECORD to start recording your response. Please note that responses for each question can only be submitted one time.

We recommend that you take the practice test in a quiet environment, use a good quality microphone, and that you speak directly into the microphone using your normal speaking volume.

When your recording time is up, you can play your response to review it. You can re-record your response or submit it to be scored. Once you submit a response, you will not be able to access the recording or make changes. If you are unable to submit your responses, please contact toefltestprep@ets.org for more information. 

After you have submitted all four responses, they will be scored. You will receive a scaled score range within 24 hours of submitting your last response.

Your scaled score does not count toward your course grade. You will get credit for your responses when you answer "yes" to the question about completing those activities in Speaking Quiz 6.

Please note:

The practice questions are real TOEFL iBT® test questions, but the testing experience has been adapted for this course. For example:
*Although you are able to control the audio passages in this practice test, in the real test you will only hear audio passages once, without pauses. 
*Transcripts of conversations and lectures are available in this practice test, but not on the actual test. 
*In this practice test, you can control when to start your Preparation Time and Response Time. In the real test, both start automatically and cannot be controlled by the test taker. 

Your performance on this practice test is not a predictor of how you might perform on the actual TOEFL iBT test.

Scaled score ranges and scoring information are for preparation use only; they are not official scores.

System Requirements
*Microphone
*Speakers or headphones
*Web browser: -Chrome (version 59 or later) is the optimum browser.
-Firefox (version 54.0.1 or later) can be used, but there may be delays when using Firefox on your phone. 

*Operating System -Please note: iOS and OSX based Devices (all version of iPhone, iPad, and Mac) are not supported at this time.

University Should Allow Eating in Class
Currently, there is a university-wide policy that prohibits eating in the classroom. I disagree with this policy. I think students should be allowed to eat in class. This change would be good for two reasons. For one thing, if students were permitted to eat, they would be able to concentrate better, because students often get hungry during long classes, and hunger makes it difficult to concentrate. Also, if food were allowed in classrooms, it would be possible for us to have in-class parties on the last day of class--with snack foods and beverages--to celebrate the end of each semester.

Sincerely,

Nancy Myers

Speaking Practice Test: Question Type 3
Narrator
A student has written a letter to the university newspaper. You have 50 seconds to read the letter. Begin reading now.
Narrator
Now listen to two students discussing the letter.
Female student
Did you see this letter, Jim?
Male student
Yeah.
Female student
Be kinda nice to be able to do that, huh?
Male student
No, actually ... I don't think it's a good idea.
Female student
Why not?
Male student
Well, like the part about how it'll help students concentrate--I mean, maybe a little snack will help the person who's eating it, but the trouble is that it makes it hard for everyone else to concentrate, 'cause they have to listen to someone munching on chips, or biting into an apple ... or crinkling paper wrappers.

Female student
I guess it can be kinda disruptive ...
Male student
Yeah ... it would interfere with everyone's concentration. You wouldn't be able to pay attention with all the noises going on ...
Female student
OK ... I guess I have to agree with you on that ... But what about her other reason? It would be nice to be able to have some fun at the end of the semester, right?
Male student
No, there's a problem with that, too.
Female student
Why?
Male student
Well, I don't think it's appropriate to use classtime for that kind of thing. I mean, the last classes are usually pretty important ... that's when we do a lot of reviewing for final exams.
Female student
True ...
Male student
If we used that time for that, we probably wouldn't have time to do as much reviewing, which means we wouldn't be as well-prepared for exams.

Female student
Yeah, I hadn't thought of that.
Narrator
The man expresses his opinion about the proposal in the newspaper. Briefly summarize the proposal. Then state the man's opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.

Speaking Question 4
Directions:You will now read a short passage and listen to a lecture on the same topic. You will then be asked a question about them. After you hear the question, give yourself 30 seconds to prepare your response. Then record yourself speaking for 60 seconds. Play the audio to begin.

Comfort Zone Bias
Psychologists have found that when people make important decisions, they often choose to stay in their "comfort zones"; that is, they prefer remaining in comfortable, familiar situations, rather than entering into new, unfamiliar ones. This tendency is often referred to as the comfort zone bias. When people are reasonably content, they often decide not to pursue a new opportunity, even if it attracts them and offers more advantages. Psychologists believe that the comfort zone bias exists not only because we have a natural preference for what we already know, but also because we want to avoid taking risks.

Narrator
Now listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class.
Professor
OK, so this comes up a lot when people make career decisions. A friend of mine from college always wanted to be a film reviewer--he was a film major and he loved movies. Most of all, he loved to write about movies. So when he graduated he looked for a job as a film reviewer for a newspaper because as a film reviewer, he'd get to see films for free and would be paid to write about them. That's what he loved. But he couldn't find a job as a film reviewer, so he took a position asa news reporter instead, for a newspaper... investigating stories, writing about events: what news reporters do. Now at first my friend wasn't sure he'd be any good at this'he'd never been a news reporter before. But eventually he adjusted and gained confidence, and he got used to the job. And he realized he was actually a pretty good reporter.

Anyway, here's the thing: after a few years, the film reviewer for the newspaper where he worked quit, and my friend was offered her job. This was his dream, right?His opportunity to be a film reviewer had finally come. And the new job would actually pay more too. But did he take the job? Nope. He turned it down. He told me he had gotten used to being a news reporter, and he just didn't want to try something else. It seemed like too big of a change since, well, there was a chance that the new job might not work out.

Hi everyone.

By now you should have submitted your responses to the four Speaking questions that were assigned in the previous unit.

One was the Independent Speaking question, and three were Integrated Speaking questions.

The responses are scored by our automated scoring engine called SpeechRater, which looks for key characteristics in your speaking responses and assigns a score. This can give you some idea of how your responses would be scored on the real test.

In this unit, you will see some additional sample responses and their scores, with comments from the raters about why they received those scores.

You'll notice that even the ones with the highest scores aren't perfect, but they meet the criteria for that score level.

Keep up the great work!

--Molly

Sample Responses - Question 1

Let's Review:

Below are points that are important to include when answering Question 1, followed by sample responses and comments from real TOEFL raters. If you need to review Question 1, go to the bottom of the page.

Important Points:

When you respond to this item, you should choose one type or genre of book and explain why you like it so much, or why you enjoy it more than the other types of books. In your response, you should give and discuss at least one reason to help explain why you like that type of book. It is OK to give more than one reason for why you like a certain type of book, but you should be careful not to only state a list of reasons without providing any explanations or details to support the reasons. Rather, a good approach is to try to focus on one reason and discuss it in detail. To support your reason, you could talk about a specific book, an experience with a certain type of book, or some other experience or story that explains why you like that type of book.

Sample Responses:
Here are some responses from Sarthak G. from India and Nihal O. from Turkey. Let's take a look at their responses together!

Listen to Sarthak G's high-level response.


Transcript of Response:

I like reading biography books the most, there're two reasons for it. First, uh, we can learn some pretty good productivity hacks from these books. Like I have read about Jerry Seinfeld where he uses the Seinfeld strategy, which is to at least write something daily, be it good, bad, but he used to write daily. Uh, second reason would be, you can find the right motivation. Um, like, as in the case when things are going down south for you, you can keep pushing for your dreams, you can keep on pursuing it, and, things will do go right, like in the case of Google founders, um, Larry Page and Sergey Brin--they were rejected by Yahoo, uh, but now they are successful. Google is a very successful company.

Rater Comments:

This is an example of a high-level response. In the beginning of the response, Sarthak clearly states his preference for biographies, and then goes on to explain why he likes biographies so much. His first reason is that you can learn from biographies by seeing how other people do things. His second reason is that biographies can provide their readers with motivation. He explains that the founders of Google were successful even after facing rejection, though it is not completely clear how this has motivated Sarthak (or if he learned about it in a biography). This response would be even more full and complete if Sarthak provided a clearer explanation of how biographies personally motivate him. In terms of the delivery of the response, Sarthak has a noticeable accent, but he speaks clearly and his accent does not make it difficult for listeners to understand him. He effectively uses some idiomatic phrases, such as, "productivity hacks" and "when things are going down south for you." While there are some minor errors ("second reason would be," instead of "the second reason would be," and "things will do go right," instead of "things will go all right"), the response is overall very clear and mostly complete.

Listen to Nihal O.'s mid-level response.


Transcript of Mid-level Response:

I think adventure books more enjoyable than other books, because, uh, other books generally based on, uh, only one topic or only one event, but adventure books has lots of events and topics, uh, so I think adventure books more fluently and enjoyable than other books when I, uh, reading, uh, adventure books, uh, I can't understand how I spent my time. Uh, it is so fast for me.

Rater Comments:

Nihal O.'s response is mid-level. She does a good job of clearly stating which type of books she enjoys the most (adventure books) and starts to explain why she likes these books, but parts of her explanation are somewhat unclear. For example, when talking about how enjoyable these books are, she says, "when I, uh, reading, uh, adventure books, uh, I can"t understand how I spent my time. Uh, it is so fast for me." A more effective way of expressing this idea would be to say, "When I"m reading adventure books, time goes by so quickly. I'm so focused on what I'm reading that I lose track of time." Grammatically, this response has room for improvement, such as changing "adventure books more enjoyable than other books," to "adventure books are more enjoyable than other books," or saying "adventure books have lots of events" instead of "adventure books has lots of events." Nihal speaks with some hesitations and pauses, but her pronunciation is mostly clear. To improve this response, she could provide clearer explanations for her ideas and try to pause less frequently in between words and phrases.

Sample Responses - Question 2

Let's Review:

Below are points that are important to include when answering Question 2, followed by sample responses and comments from real TOEFL raters. If you need to review Question 2, go to the bottom of the page.

Important Points:

When you answer this item, you should say whether you agree or disagree that making mistakes is one of the best ways to learn, and then explain why you think that. You can choose either point of view, and you will not be scored based on which choice you make. The content of your response will be evaluated based on how well you support your opinion and explain your ideas. If you agree that making mistakes is one of the best ways to learn, you should use specific examples to explain why making mistakes is a good way to learn or can help people learn. If you disagree with the statement, you should provide at least one reason or example to explain why making mistakes is not a good way to learn.

Annotate

Listen to a high-level response from a real test taker.


Transcript of High-level Sample Response:

The statement if one of the best ways to learn, uh, by making mistakes, it's, can be, um, can be discussed controversially but I personally think that the statement is complicate because, um, it is definitely one of the best ways to learn if you do mistakes yourself. I personally, uh, tried, uh, to, um, apply once for a consulting job and, uh, I made the mistake to not inform myself about the company and so I came to, um, to the assessment center and didn't know anything so it was a great mistake, uh, performed by me and so afterwards I wouldn't do this mistake again. So if I apply the next time, I will be, uh, prepared in a, in a correct manner.

Rater Comments:

This is an example of a high-level response. The speaker gives a full, clear response after struggling at the beginning. His first sentence is confusing, but he is then able to provide a solid response. He makes a couple of grammatical and word choice errors ("the statement is complicate" instead of "the statement is complicated" and "I wouldn"t do this mistake again" instead of "I wouldn't make this mistake again"), but the message is clear and these minor errors do not interfere with his meaning. Because the speaker states his stance about the statement and provides a clear personal example, this response is easy to understand and the speaker's stance is well justified. His delivery is also very clear, and no words or phrases are difficult to understand.

Listen to a mid-level response from a real test taker.


Transcript of Mid-level Sample Response:

In my opinion, I totally agree with this statement. That learning by making mistakes is the one of the best ways, because a couple of reasons. For instance, when I was a high school students, uh, I always try to get a high degree in my math class. But at that time I really didn't know about to how to resolve the every questions. So I tried the several ways even though I mistakes a lot of the time and I had to spend a lot of time to get the correct answer but after doing that, I, right now I couldn't find the correct way and very easy and fast and the study guidelines so I can get the grade, the high grade.

Rater Comments:

This is an example of a mid-level response. The speaker has a rather strong accent, but is for the most part still relatively easy to understand, and he provides a sustained response. He starts off strong by stating his opinion (that he agrees with the statement), and attempting to provide an example of a personal experience in order to explain why he agrees. The example is somewhat unclear, however, and it isn't obvious how making mistakes helped him learn math. Near the end of the explanation, he says, "right now I couldn't find the correct way," which is confusing since it sounded like he was talking about how he learned to improve in math (a listener would expect him to say something like, "Now I can always find the correct way to solve a problem."). The response has some grammatical and vocabulary issues as well, such as extra articles ("how to resolve the every questions" and "I tried the several ways" instead of "I tried several ways") and some confusing sentences ("I always try to get a high degree in my math class" instead of "I always tried to do well/get a high grade in math classes"). 

Let's Review:

Below are points that are important to include when answering Question 3, followed by sample responses and comments from real TOEFL raters. If you need to review Question 3, go to the bottom of the page.

Important Points:

In your response to this item, you should be sure to include and integrate information from both the reading passage and the conversation. You could start your response by briefly explaining what the student (Nancy) wrote about in her letter; Nancy explained that students currently are not allowed to eat in classes, and proposes that this policy should change so that students can eat in their classes. You should then explain that the man in the conversation disagrees with Nancy's proposal. First, you could explain that he disagrees with Nancy's idea that being able to eat during class will help students concentrate (because they won't be hungry), since listening to students eating during class would be distracting. You should also explain that he doesn't think that having in-class parties at the end of the semester, as Nancy suggests, is a good reason to change the policy. He doesn't think that having parties during class time is a good use of time, since the classes at the end of the semester are important and help students review for final exams.


Sample Responses:
Here are responses from Khrystyna from Ukraine and Vu Anh P. from Vietnam. Let's take a look at their responses together!


Listen to Khrystyna's high-level response.


Transcript of High-level Response:

The main point that I read in this letter was the student was complaining about the, um, that the food is not allowed at the classes because the classes tend to be pretty long and the people can, like students can be hungry and this is like, prevents concentration, you can't concentrate when you're hungry and the other opinion that you can't you know like do the end-of-semester parties but the student at the conversation, I, is against it, uh, because, um, for the one person who's eating it helps to concentrate, but for the other who hear like this munching and chewing sound it can be pretty distracting and I do agree with this. Um, and the classes that are at the end of the semester are very important so those parties are not necessarily in the crucial at the end of the year so that's like those two guys', students' opinion. 

Rater Comments:

Khrystyna gives a high-level response. She does not explicitly state the proposal (that Nancy thinks eating should be allowed in class), but she implicitly communicates this by explaining that the letter-writer is complaining about food not being allowed in class, and she also includes the reasons why the person who wrote the letter thinks this is bad ("can't concentrate when you're hungry" and "you can"t you know like do the end-of-semester parties"). She then clearly states that the student in the conversation disagrees, along with his reasons for disagreeing. Some of the phrases Khrystyna uses sound a bit unnatural due to her use of prepositions (for example, she says, "not allowed at the classes," instead of "not allowed in the classes," "the student at the conversation" instead of "the student in the conversation," and "not necessarily in the crucial" instead of "not necessarily crucial"), but these errors do not make the response difficult to understand. Khrystyna makes good use of time and uses intonation effectively in order to emphasize certain points (for example, her emphasis on "pretty" when she says, "the classes tend to be pretty long").


Listen to Vu Anh P's mid-level response.


Transcript of Response:

The newsletter suggest that, uh, students should, uh, be allowed to eat in class for two reasons. First of all, uh, eating in class may help students concentrate better, uh, because, uh, after a long class they can be very hungry. And the second reason is that, uh, they can have, uh, they can party at the end of the semester. However the man disagree with this. Uh, he, uh, gives two reasons. The first one, uh, is that, uh, he, uh, it's maybe true that we can concentrate while we eat, but we will disrupt other because of the noise that we make while we are eating. And, uh, the second one is that, um, at the end of the semester, uh, more, most class will use that for reviewing for the exams, so using that time would not, uh, be appropriate and we will less prepare.

Rater Comments:

This is an example of a mid-level response. Vu Anh covers the main points from the student letter and the conversation between the students, though some important details are missing. His explanation of the proposal is clear, as is his explanation about why eating in class might help some students concentrate but be distracting for other students. His discussion of the point about having parties is somewhat unclear, however, since he doesn't explain that the man is against having parties during class time--Vu Anh says, "using that time would not be appropriate," but does not explain what he means by this or how this is connected to class parties. A clearer way Vu Anh could express this could be to say, "He doesn't think using class time for parties is appropriate because students need that time to review for exams." Vu Anh's pronunciation is at times slightly difficult to understand and his pace is a bit slow with noticeable "uhs," but overall the response is comprehensible. The response could be clearer with more variation in the grammatical structures used; for example, "we will less prepare," would be more effective as "students would be less prepared." Vu Anh makes some minor agreement errors ("the newsletter suggest," "the man disagree," "most class"), but is also able to effectively produce extended speech.


Sample Responses - Question 4

Let's Review:

Below are points that are important to include when answering Question 4, followed by sample responses and comments from real TOEFL raters. If you need to review Question 4, go to the bottom of the page.

Important Points:

When responding to this item, it is important to integrate information from both the reading passage and the lecture--you should summarize important information from the professor's lecture AND explain how it illustrates the concept that is described in the reading passage. One way you could begin your response is by briefly describing the comfort zone bias, which is the tendency for people to make decisions that let them remain in comfortable, familiar situations, rather than take the risk of trying new situations, even if a new situation might be better for them. You could then discuss the professor's example, being sure to connect it to the comfort zone bias. You could explain that the professor's friend had a job as a news reporter and was comfortable with that job. When he was offered his dream job (to write movie reviews), he exhibited the comfort zone bias by turning down the new job because he didn't want to risk making a change.

Actual Test Taker Responses:
Listen to a high-level response from a real test taker.


Transcript of High-level Sample Response:

Well, in this case, uh, the man, uh, had, uh, he always dreamed about being a, a repor--a film reviewer, however he originally did not get that job so he was forced to be a, a journalist. Um, after years he got the option to be, um, a film reviewer, uh, he had that opportunity, but he was already, he was used to, to being, uh, working as a, in the news as a journalist, so that was his comfort zone. He was very familiar in a familiar setting he was, he knew his job so, uh, he, he didn't want to take new risks so he decided to stay in his job as a, as a journalist and he did not, uh, take his dream job just because he preferred to stay, uh, within his comfort zone.

Rater Comments:

This is an example of a high-level response. The speaker approached the response a little differently than the method described in the Important Points, since he implicitly explained the concept of the comfort zone bias throughout his response, rather than starting the response with a definition of the concept. Even though the speaker never used the phrase "comfort zone bias," he clearly explained the concept through the example of the journalist, explaining that the journalist "was used to " working as a journalist .. that was his comfort zone," and "didn't want to take new risks .. he did not take his dream job just because he preferred to stay within his comfort zone." The speaker's clear delivery, including effective use of intonation, as well as effective use of vocabulary, make this response very clear and easy to understand.

Listen to a mid-level response from a real test taker.


Transcript of Mid-level Sample Response:

Um, the subject is, uh, when man decide, uh, make a, make a decision, uh, they tend to make a decision familiar with, uh, him or comfortable for him rather than new situation. Um, in the lecture, uh, the professor said, uh, explain some example that his friend is working as a news reporter but, uh, his dream is to be film reviewer. Finally he, he, he's going to get a new job as a film reviewer, uh, and that and, uh, if he, he, he is a, uh, he become film reviewer he can be pay, pay more but he refuse.

Rater Comments:

This is an example of a mid-level response. In this response, the speaker starts by attempting to define the concept of the comfort zone bias. He is able to use some key vocabulary from the reading passage as he talks about decision making, the familiar/comfortable, and new situations. This definition is somewhat vague, however, likely because the speaker did not use a variety of grammatical structures to convey his meaning. For example, the phrase, "they tend to make a decision familiar with him .. rather than new situation" contains some key information but is unclear. A more effective way to say this would have been, "they tend to make decisions that allow them to stay in a familiar or comfortable situation, rather than trying out a new situation." The speaker's summary of the example in the lecture contains some important points but is cut short, partially because of the speaker's slow pace and frequent pauses between words and phrases. This speaker would probably be able to produce a more complete response if he were able to comfortably use a variety of grammatical structures and speak more quickly and fluidly (with fewer pauses).
