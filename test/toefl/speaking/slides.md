About the Speaking Section
The third section of the TOEFL iBT® test is the Speaking section.

In this section, you will be asked to speak on a variety of topics that draw on personal experience, campus-based situations, and academic materials. 

The Speaking section takes about 17 minutes to complete, and there are 4 questions. 

Questions 1 is the Independent Speaking question, which is on a topic that is familiar to you. 

Questions 2 through 4 are the Integrated Speaking questions. For these questions, you have to use more than one skill. Some questions require you to read, listen, and then speak, while others require you to listen and then speak. When you listen, you will hear accents from North America, and you may also hear accents from the U.K., New Zealand or Australia.

For all Speaking questions, you use a headset with a microphone to record your responses. Your responses are sent to ETS to be scored by certified raters. The Speaking section score will be on a scale from 0-30. 

You will learn more details about the Speaking section this week through a series of videos about the different Speaking question types.

Timing and Approach

The TOEFL® test will take you through each of the 4 Speaking questions, giving you a certain amount of time to prepare and speak for each one. Depending on the question type, you will have between 15 and 30 seconds to prepare your Speaking response. It’s important that you use this time to decide what you want to say, but do not try to write down your full response; you won’t have time to write everything down, and raters expect to hear you speaking naturally, not reading from a script. Then, you will have 45 or 60 seconds to actually speak your response. These times will be displayed with a countdown clock on your computer screen so that you will know how much time you have left to prepare and to speak. The following table shows how much time you have to prepare and speak your response for each question type. 

Question Type	Preparation Time	Response Time
1	15 seconds	45 seconds
2	30 seconds	60 seconds
3	30 seconds	60 seconds
4	20 seconds	60 seconds
Remember, your response should only provide content that the question asks of you. For questions 1, try to keep things simple and focused on the main message you want to share. Then, support your main message with examples or details. For questions 2 through 4, don't try to repeat everything you heard in a conversation or lecture. You should expect the Speaking section to last for about a total of 17 minutes.
