- Hi, I'm Molly Palmer,


your speaking expert and TOEFL instructor this week.


As you probably know, being able to speak well


in English can open up many opportunities for you.


Both academically, and socially.


Any time you're learning something new


there will be challenges.


And speaking in English is no exception.


But don't worry.


We're here to help you navigate your way


through this journey


and improve your spoken English.


We spoke to a few students, just like you,


about their concerns, challenges,


and successes, as they learned to speak English.


Here's what they told us.


- [Voiceover] I'm worried about my accent.


Will people be able to understand me?


- [Voiceover] I was nervous to speak in English


because I was scared to make mistakes.


Will people judge me?


I've been learning English for a while now


and I realized that everyone makes mistakes.


What's important is that I'm not giving up,


so I keep practicing.


- [Voiceover] I'm not used to working together


with my classmates on projects.


I'm not sure what to expect.


Will talking to them be hard for me?


- [Voiceover] Back in school, when I was young,


I was so scared speaking in English,


and I was uncomfortable in front of people


when I speak English because


I wasn't so confident.


- [Voiceover] When I speak, I have sometimes


problems with the sounds that are different


from my native language.


And people ask me sometimes


to repeat some of the words.


- [Voiceover] Practicing speaking with a partner


really helped me to build confidence


in my own speaking skills.


Now I feel comfortable speaking English


in both my university classes,


and when I'm just hanging out with my friends


outside the classroom.


- [Voiceover] When I started learning English,


I think the grammar part challenged me the most.


From a different language background, like Chinese,


I don't need to differentiate the past,


the future, the present tense in my own language.


But in English, I need to think about


the grammar, the tense, almost always.


So, this ongoing thinking process


really challenged me.


- [Voiceover] I think it's very helpful to talk


to native speakers.


- [Voiceover] It's not impossible.


If I'm doing it, you can do it too.


- Let's address some of the concerns


you have about speaking in English


by preparing together.


This week, we're going to take a deeper look


into the speaking section of the TOEFL IBT test.


First, we'll discuss the question types


that you'll see on the test.


Then, we'll provide you with some tips and advice


on how to answer the questions.


And then, you'll have a chance to practice


answering actual speaking questions yourself.


Let's get started.

[♪MUSIC♪]


In 2005, when ETS first launched the TOEFL iBT test,


people were concerned about having to talk to a computer


during the Speaking section instead of to a live person.


These days, we don't get as many questions about it.


Maybe that's because now people are talking to computers


and other devices quite often.


For example, I can ask my phone,


where's the nearest Indian restaurant?


Anyway, it's important for you to be comfortable


in front of the computer during the Speaking section


so that you can focus on answering the questions


and do your best.


If, right now, you feel uncomfortable talking at a computer,


just remember this: when you speak your responses


into the microphone, the computer isn't judging you.


It doesn't care what you look like or what you're wearing


or know what you did with your hair that day.


But if you have an interview


and the interviewer is scoring your responses,


then those are all things that the interviewer can see


and they could negatively affect your score,


even unintentionally.


So, hopefully when you realize


that the computer isn't judging you,


that will help you to relax,


focus on the topic you're speaking about


and give your best response.


Now, if you're the kind of person


who really just prefers to be interacting


with someone when you speak, try this:


when you're taking the test,


just imagine that you're with someone you trust,


maybe a friend, a family member, a classmate.


Pretend you're talking to that person


about what the main point of the lecture is


or whatever the speaking question is about.


Pretend it's part of a conversation


and you may be more comfortable giving your response.


One last piece of advice


for getting comfortable talking to a computer: practice.


Find some real sample questions from the TOEFL website


and record your answers


on whatever device you have available,


even if it's something like this.


Have fun.

So, here is generally what the question will look like


and how it's structured.


For question one, you'll be given a topic to speak about


with no additional reading or listening passages.


You'll have 15 seconds to prepare your response


and 45 seconds to speak your answer.


Now, 15 seconds is actually longer than you think,


and if you feel like you need more time,


just remember that professors at university


aren't going to give you more time than


that to answer questions in class.


Now, let's look more closely at what the Independent Speaking


question will be asking you to do.


In question one, you'll be presented


with two situations or opinions.


You'll be asked which you prefer


and you need to explain your choice.


Here's an example.


[Audio example]: Some people think it is more fun


to spend time with friends in restaurants or cafes.


Others think it is more fun to spend time with friends at home.


Which do you think is better?


Explain why.

Independent Speaking Question 1: Approach Tips

Now let’s look at some tips about how to approach the Independent Speaking question. 

transcript
Start of transcript. Skip to the end.

Now here are some tips for how to approach


these kinds of speaking questions.


Number one: Use the preparation time to organize your thoughts


and maybe jot down some notes.


Don't try to write a full response


because you won't have time,


and the raters scoring your response


want to hear you speaking, not reading,


and they can tell the difference.


Number two: Don't memorize responses before the test,


especially ones that you get from the Internet


or from test prep instructors who say that's a good idea.


It's not, and it will lower your score.


It's very easy for ETS raters to identify memorized responses


because they sound different and the content is different


from responses that are more natural and spontaneous.


Number three: It's not necessary to organize


your response into an introduction,


a middle and a conclusion like you would with a written essay.


Just speak naturally and use common connecting words.


Some of those are:


because, so, after that,


on the other hand, I want to mention,


and what this means is.

Integrated Question 2

In question 2, you will be asked about a speaker’s opinion and how it relates to ideas in a reading passage about a campus-related change. Note that you will not be able to see the reading passage while you speak your response.


Start of transcript.

So, here is generally what the question will look like


and how it's structured.


In question two, you will read a passage


about a campus-related topic.


Then, you will listen to a conversation about that topic.


Then, you will have 30 seconds to prepare your response


and 60 seconds to speak your answer.


Now, let's look more closely at what campus-situations questions


look like and what they will be asking you to do.


For question two,


where you have both reading and listening passages,


you will be asked what the opinion is of a speaker


in the listening passage, and you'll need to explain how


that person's opinion relates to the issues


presented in the reading passage.


So, you're essentially summarizing


and combining information from two sources.


Here's an example of this type of question.


Male Voice: That's true, but think about it.


Have you ever seen the space completely full?


Female Voice: Well, uh, no. I guess not.


Male Voice: Me either.


There are never any events


when the entire student body is there.


In fact, there are usually just a small number of students


in the audience for a play or a concert.


Female Voice: That's true.


Male Voice: So why make it bigger if it works as is?


Female Voice: I see what you mean.


Male voice: The man expresses his opinion


of the university's plan.


State his opinion,


and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.

Integrated Speaking Question 2: Approach Tips
Now let’s look at some tips about how to approach Integrated Speaking question. 

Start of transcript. Skip to the end.

Now here are some tips for
how to approach these kinds of Speaking questions.
Number one: Be careful not to speak too quickly
because this might make it difficult
for the rater to understand you.
The questions are designed
so that if you speak at a normal pace,
you will have enough time to give a complete response.
You'll get better at this if you time yourself when you practice.
Number two: In question two,
where you have the reading passage
then the conversation between two speakers,
listen carefully to the speaker's reasons
for agreeing or disagreeing with points made in the reading.
Then, make sure you summarize
the opinion of the speaker in your answer.

You'll have 30 seconds to prepare your response,
and 60 seconds to speak your answer.
In question four, you'll listen to part of a lecture.
Then, you will have 20 seconds to prepare your response
and 60 seconds to speak your answer,

On-screen: ETS® TOEFL® Speaking Questions 3 & 5: Campus Situations
 

Michael: Hi, I'm Michael from ETS, and welcome to Inside the TOEFL Test. 

Michael: Today, we're going inside the Speaking section, specifically questions three and five, the Integrated Speaking questions about campus situations.

On-screen: Introduction
•Question Structure
•Approach Tips
•Scoring Criteria
•Sample Response
• Skill-Building Tips

Michael: So, in the next few minutes, we're going to look at how the questions are structured and what they're asking, how to approach the questions, how your responses are scored. We'll look at a sample response that received a high score, and we'll give you some tips for improving your speaking skills.

On-screen: Question 3
•Read a passage
•Listen to a response
•30 seconds to prepare
•60 seconds to speak

Michael: So, here is generally what the questions will look like and how they're structured.  In question three, you will read a passage about a campus-related topic. Then, you will listen to a response to that topic. Then, you will have 30 seconds to prepare your response and 60 seconds to speak your answer.

On-screen: Question 5
•Listen to conversation
•20 seconds to prepare
•60 seconds to speak

Michael: For question five, you listen to part of a conversation. Then, you'll have 20 seconds to prepare your response and sixty seconds to speak your answer. 

Now, let's look more closely at what these campus-situation questions look like and what they will be asking you to do. For question three, where you have both reading and listening passages, you will be asked what the opinion is of a speaker in the listening passage, and you'll need to explain how that person's opinion relates to the issues presented in the reading passage.

On Screen: Good News for Movie Fans

The Student Association has just purchased a new sound system for the Old Lincoln Hall auditorium, the place where movies on campus are currently shown. By installing the new sound system, the Student Association hopes to attract more students to the movies and increase ticket sales. Before making the purchase of the new equipment, the Student Association conducted a survey on campus to see what kind of entertainment students liked best. Going to the movies ranked number one. "Students at Northfield College love going to the movies," said the president of the Student Association "so we decided to make what they already love even better. We're confident that the investment into the sound system will translate into increased ticket sales."

Michael: So, you're essentially summarizing and combining information from two sources. Here's an example of this type of question. This one is about the student government's decision to buy a new sound system.

Male Voice: What else is there to do on campus?

Female Voice: What do you mean?

Male Voice: I mean there isn't much to do on campus besides go to the movies. If there were other forms of recreation or other social activities, you know, I don't think most students would have said that going to the movies was their first choice.

On-screen:

The man expresses his opinion of the student association's recent purchase. State his opinion and explain the reasons he gives for holding that opinion.

Michael: For question five, where the listening passage is a conversation about a campus problem and one or more solutions, you'll need to describe the problem and then give your opinion about what the solution should be.

Here's the example of question five about tutors and study groups.

Female Voice: Another option, I guess, is to form a study group with other students. That won't cost you any money.

Male Voice: That's a thought. Although, once I was in a study group and it was a big waste of time. We usually ended up talking about other stuff like what we did over the weekend.

Female Voice: But, that was for a different class, right? I've actually had some pretty good experiences with study groups. Usually students in the same class have different strengths and weaknesses with the material. If they're serious about studying, they can really help each other out. Think about it.

On-screen: Briefly summarize the problem the speakers are discussing. Then state which solution you would recommend. Explain the reasons for your recommendation.

On-screen: Approach Tips
•Don't speak too quickly
•Speak at a normal pace
•Time yourself when you practice

Michael: Now here are some tips how to approach these kinds of Speaking questions. Number one: Be careful not to speak too quickly because this might make it difficult for the rater to understand you. The questions are designed so that if you speak at a normal pace, you will have enough time to give a complete response. You'll get better at this if you time yourself when you practice.

On-screen: Question 3
•Listen carefully to the speaker's reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with points made in the reading.
•Make sure you summarize the opinion of the speaker.

Michael: Number two: In question three, where you have the reading passage then the conversation between two speakers, listen carefully to the speaker's reasons for agreeing or disagreeing with points made in the reading. Then, make sure you summarize the opinion of the speaker in your answer.

On-screen: Question 5
•As you listen, focus on identifying and understanding what the problem and possible solutions are.
•Do more than summarize in your response. You also need to give your opinion.
•Explain why it is the best solution.

Michael: Number three: For question five, as you listen, focus on identifying and understanding what the problem and possible solutions are. Then, write down a few key words or ideas on your scratch paper. But remember, you need to do more than summarize in your response. You also need to give your opinion. So, don't spend too much time summarizing. Use most of your time explaining why it is the best solution.

On-screen: Scoring Criteria
•0 to 4
•Scored holistically

Michael: Before the test, make sure you understand what the raters are looking for and how the questions are scored.  In the Speaking section, all six responses are scored on a scale from zero to four, and they're scored holistically, which means the raters listen for various features in your response and then give it an overall score.

On-screen: Delivery
•Clear and fluid speech
•Good pronunciation
•Natural pace
•Good intonation

Michael: Although there are some variations depending on the question, raters will be looking for three main things. First, delivery: Your speech needs to be clear and fluid with good pronunciation. The pace or speed of your speech should be natural, and you should have good-sounding intonation patterns.


On-screen: Language use
•Use of grammar and vocabulary to express your ideas

Michael: Second, language use: This is mainly how you use grammar and vocabulary to express your ideas. 

On-screen: Topic development
•How fully you answer
•How clearly you express your ideas
•How you connect ideas

Michael: Third, topic development: This is mainly how fully you answer the question, how clearly you express your ideas and how you can connect one idea to the next in a way that it is easy to follow.

On-screen: Sample response
•Score of 3 on 0 to 4 scale

Michael: Now, let's listen to an example of a Speaking response that received a score of three on a four-point scale. This one is responding to question five about tutors and study groups.

Audio Example [female voice]: The man has a problem that he takes a calculus test that he does not do well in the calculus. He's worried about the final. There are two possible solutions. The first one is that the tutoring program, and the second solution is to form a study group.  I think that the second solution is better than the first one for several reasons. The first reason is that study group does not need money, but still gets help. Also, students in the study group take the same class. So, they can explain to each other what the lecture said about. Finally, if students concentrate on the study group, they can improve their grades at final exam because they can talk about the class concepts.

Michael: Now, let's look at this response in terms of our three main criteria — delivery, language use and topic development.

On-screen: Sample Response
•Delivery
•Language use
•Topic development

Michael: First, delivery: The speaker is generally easy to understand with good pronunciation and pacing. So, she gets a good score for delivery.

Audio Example [female voice]: He does not do well in the calculus. He's worried about the final.

On-screen: Language use

Michael: But, language use is another story. We can't give this response a four out of four mainly because of her imprecise use of language. One example is when she says this.

Audio Example [female voice]: Study group does not need money, but still gets help.

This could have been much more precise by saying, for example, "Students can get help from a study group without spending money."

On-screen: Topic Development

Michael: Topic development is actually quite good in this response.  She communicates the important information in a clear and coherent way by stating the man's problem and efficiently summarizing the two proposed solutions.

Audio Example [female voice]: I think that the second solution is better than the first one for several reasons.

Michael: And, she explains the reasons for her preference in terms of the advantages of study groups— basically, that they are both free and helpful.

On-screen: Sample Response
•Delivery
•Language use
•Topic development
•Score of 3 on 0 to 4 scale
•www.toeflgoanywhere.org

Michael: So, overall, this meets all the criteria for a score of three out of four. For more details about how the Integrated Speaking responses are scored, see the Speaking Scoring Guides on the TOEFL website.

On-screen: Skill-Building Tips

Michael: Now, here are some activities that can help you build your skills for the Integrated Speaking tasks, especially numbers three and five about campus situations.

On-screen: Skill-Building Tips
•Find an online newspaper from an English-speaking university.
•Look for topics about campus life.
•Choose an article to discuss with a partner.

Michael: One, find an online newspaper from an English-speaking university. This would be a good source of practice topics for questions three and five. Look for topics like admissions, housing, student activities, registering for classes, school improvement plans, sports and more. Then, choose an article to discuss with your speaking partner or study group.

On-screen: Skill-Building Tips

•Record yourself and listen to how you speak.
•Listen to hear your mistakes, as well as your tone and pacing.


Michael: Two, record yourself when you practice and listen to how you speak. When you listen to yourself, you'll be able to hear some of your mistakes as well as your tone and pacing.

On-screen: Skill-Building Tips
•Find listening and reading material on the same topic.
•Outline a one-minute response, including your opinion and supporting points.

Michael: Three, find listening and reading material that are both about the same topic. The material can contain similar or different views. Then, prepare an outline of a one-minute response that includes your opinion, two points to support your opinion, and one detail or reason to support each point.

On-screen: Skill-Building Tips
•Practice improving your fluency.
•Try to smooth out your phrasing, use different wording, avoid pauses, use transition words, and so on.

Michael: Four, practice improving your fluency. Take that one-minute presentation and deliver it a few times, and each time try to improve it a little bit, smooth out your phrasing, use different wording for the same ideas, avoid unnecessary pauses, use transition words, those kinds of things.

On-screen: ETS TOEFL® Speaking Questions 3 & 5: Campus Situations.

Michael: There are lots of ways to improve your English skills. Whatever you do, keep practicing and good luck on your TOEFL test.

Integrated Question 3

In question 3, you are asked to combine and convey information from a reading passage and a lecture. Note that you will not be able to see the reading passage while you speak your response.


Now, let's look more closely
at what these academic-courses questions look like
and what they will be asking you to do.
For question three,
the reading passage will always be about
an important academic term or concept
that might be found in a first-year college textbook.
For example,
a science reading might explain what a Keystone Species is.
A reading from Psychology might describe
what it meant by emotional intelligence.
In this example, the passage is about flow.
The listening passage will be from part of a lecture
about the same topic as the reading passage.
Speaker: I think this will help you get a picture
of what your textbook is describing.
Michael: In the lecture,
you will hear details about an example of the term or concept.
Speaker: I remember passing by a classroom early one morning
just as he was leaving, and he looked terrible.
His clothes were all rumpled
and he looked like he hadn't slept all night,
and I asked if he was okay.
I was surprised when he said that he never felt better,
that he was totally happy.
He had spent the entire night in the classroom
working on a mathematics puzzle.
He didn't stop to eat dinner.
He didn't stop to sleep.
So, he worked furiously all night
and covered the blackboards in the classroom
with equations and numbers
and never realized that time was passing by.
Michael: Then, when you answer the question,
you will speak about how the example supports
or illustrates the term or concept,
like in this question about flow.
Speaker: Explain flow
and how the example used by the professor
illustrates the concept.

 ETS TOEFL® Inside the TOEFL® Test
 Speaking Questions 4 & 6: Academic Courses  

Michael: Hi, I'm Michael from ETS, and welcome to Inside the TOEFL Test. 

Michael: Today, we're going inside the Speaking section, specifically questions four and six, the Integrated Speaking questions about academic courses. 

On-screen: Introduction
•Question Structure
•Approach Tips
•Scoring Criteria
•Sample Response
• Skill-Building Tips

Michael: So, in the next few minutes, we're going to look at how the questions are structured and what they're asking, how to approach the questions, how your responses are scored. We'll look at a sample response that received a high score, and we'll give you some tips to improve your speaking skills.

On-screen: Question 4
•Read a passage
•Listen to lecture
•30 seconds to prepare
•60 seconds to speak

Michael: So, here is generally what the questions will look like and how they're structured. In question four, you will read a passage about an academic subject. Then, you will listen to part of a lecture on that same subject. You'll have 30 seconds to prepare your response, and 60 seconds to speak your answer.

On-screen: Question 6
•Listen to lecture
•20 seconds to prepare
•60 seconds to speak

Michael: For question six, you'll listen to part of a lecture. Then, you will have 20 seconds to prepare your response and 60 seconds to speak your answer, which will always be a summary of the lecture. Now, let's look more closely at what these academic-courses questions look like and what they will be asking you to do.

On-screen: Question 4: Reading passage

Michael: For question four, the reading passage will always be about an important academic term or concept that might be found in a first-year college textbook. For example, a science reading might explain what a Keystone Species is. A reading from Psychology might describe what it meant by emotional intelligence. In this example, the passage is about flow.

On-Screen: Flow

In psychology, the feeling of complete and energized focus in an activity is called flow. People who enter a state of flow lose their sense of time and have a feeling of great satisfaction. They become completely involved in an activity for its own sake rater than for what may result from the activity, such as money or prestige. Contrary to expectation, flow usually happens not during relaxing moments of leisure and entertainment, but when we are actively involved in a difficult enterprise, in a task that stretches our mental and physical abilities.

On-Screen: Question 4: Listening Passage

Michael: The listening passage will be from part of a lecture about the same topic as the reading passage.

Speaker: I think this will help you get a picture of what your textbook is describing. 

Michael: In the lecture, you will hear details about an example of the term or concept.

Speaker: I remember passing by a classroom early one morning just as he was leaving, and he looked terrible. His clothes were all rumpled and he looked like he hadn't slept all night, and I asked if he was okay. I was surprised when he said that he never felt better, that he was totally happy. He had spent the entire night in the classroom working on a mathematics puzzle. He didn't stop to eat dinner. He didn't stop to sleep. So, he worked furiously all night and covered the blackboards in the classroom with equations and numbers and never realized that time was passing by. 

On-screen: Question 4: What it's asking

Michael: Then, when you answer the question, you will speak about how the example supports or illustrates the term or concept, like in this question about flow.

On-screen: Explain flow and how the example used by the professor illustrates the concept.

Speaker: Explain flow and how the example used by the professor illustrates the concept.

On-screen: Question Structure, Question 6: Listening Passage

Michael: For question six, the listening passage is an excerpt from an academic lecture on a single topic. Usually, it starts with the professor either defining a concept or highlighting an issue. 

Speaker: Human beings aren't the only animals that use tools. It's generally…

Michael: Then, it will have examples that help explain or clarify the issue. 

Speaker: And, in fact there are two competing definitions, a narrow definition…

On-screen: Question Structure, Question 6: What it's asking

Michael: The question will ask you to explain the main concept or issue using the points and examples that were given in the lecture. So, basically, it's a very straightforward summary. Here's the example of question six about tools.

On-screen: Using points and examples from the talk, describe the two different definitions of tools given by the professor.

Speaker: Using points and examples from the talk, describe the two different definitions of tools given by the professor.

On-screen: Approach tips
•Practice with academic texts.
•You don't need prior knowledge of specific fields.
•The questions test your English.

Michael: Now, here are some tips about how to approach these kinds of Speaking questions.  Number one, the topics for these questions can be from a variety of field — life science, social science, physical science, history, art, literature. And although it's important that you practice with academic texts, the questions are designed so that you don't need any prior knowledge in a specific field to answer the question. In other words, even though a question is about an academic topic, ultimately, it's not testing your knowledge of that topic. It's testing your English.

On-screen: Approach Tips

•Take notes while listening.
•Write down key words or ideas.
•Review notes as you prepare your response.

Michael: Number two: You're allowed to take notes during the test. So, during the Listening passages, write down a few key words or ideas on your scratch paper. Then, use the preparation time to review your notes and prepare your response.

On-screen: Approach Tips

•Don't repeat yourself to fill time.
•Say something to clarify, develop or elaborate.
•Practice timing yourself.

Michael: Number three: If you finish your response before time runs out, don't just repeat yourself to fill the remaining time. Say something that clarifies, develops or elaborates on your response. Practice timing yourself so that you get used to the amount of time you have to answer a question.

On-screen: Scoring Criteria
•0 to 4
•Scored holistically

Michael: Before the test, make sure you understand what the raters are looking for and how the questions are scored. In the Speaking section, all six responses are scored on a scale from zero to four. They're scored holistically, which means the raters listen for various features in your response and then give it an overall score.

On-screen: Scoring Criteria
•Delivery
•Language use
•Topic development

On-screen: Delivery
•Clear and fluid speech
•Good pronunciation
•Natural pace
•Good intonation

Michael: Although there are some variations depending on the question, raters will be looking for three main things. First, delivery: Your speech needs to be clear and fluid with good pronunciation. The pace or speed of your speech should be natural, and you should have good-sounding intonation patterns.

On-screen: Language Use
•Use of grammar and vocabulary to express your ideas

Michael: Second, language use: This is mainly how you use grammar and vocabulary to express your ideas.

On-screen: Topic Development
•How fully you answer
•How clearly you express your ideas 
•How you connect ideas

Michael: Third, topic development: This is mainly how fully you answer the question, how clearly you express your ideas and how you can connect one idea to the next in a way that is easy to follow. 

On-screen: Sample Response

Michael: Now, let's look at this response in terms of our three main criteria — delivery, language use and topic development. The speaker's delivery is generally very clear with good pronunciation.

Michael: And while his pacing is often very good, sometimes his speech is a little choppy, and there are some hesitations that interrupt the flow of the speech.

[Audio Example]: He said he met a friend of, a friend who teached, who taught physics.

Michael: In terms of language use, his voculabary and grammer are both solid, so no major issues there.

[Audio example]: ...so concentrated on the mathematical puzzle that, he didn't sleep.

On-screen: Topic Development

Michael: For topic development, although he does give an accurate summary of the professor's example about his friend who spent the whole night working on a mathematics puzzle, he never really explains what flow is, and that's the first part of the question: "Explain flow."

[Audio example]: Explain flow.
