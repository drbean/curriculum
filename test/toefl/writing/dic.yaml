Hi, I'm Shawn, your writing expert
and TOEFL instructor for this week.
It's important to be able to express your ideas
through clear, well-organized writing.
So this week we'll take a look at how to do that.
We spoke to a few English language learners
just like you about the challenges
and successes they encountered
while learning to write in English.
- [Voiceover] Coming up with a good example
  is so hard for me when I write in English.
  Is it ok to memorize examples ahead of time,
  and then use them to support my writing
  on the test?
- [Voiceover] There are so many rules
  around English grammar and spelling.
  What if I get something wrong?
- [Voiceover] I made a list of the common errors
  I make when writing.
  Any time I write something new,
  I review it multiple times
  looking for each of the different errors.
- [Voiceover] When I'm writing English,
  I find grammar very confusing.
  In some cases same expression is correct,
  in other cases, the same expression
  is not right, so I'm confused about English grammar.
- [Voiceover] I thought it was a challenge
  for me to learn to
  put my main idea more directly
  at the beginning of a paragraph.
- [Voiceover] I have trouble planning what
  I'm going to write.
  I started writing everything that
  I would normally write in my own language
  in English instead.
  It has really helped me practice my writing.
- Let's address some of the concerns
  you have about writing by preparing together.
  This week we're going to take a deeper look
  at the writing section of the TOEFL iBT test.
  First we'll discuss the question types
  that you'll see on the test.
  We will then provide you some tips
  on how to answer the questions
  and then we'll give you a chance to
  practice answering actual TOEFL writing questions.
  So be sure to participate.
  Let's get started.

So here's generally what question 1 will look like.
For this task, you will first read a passage about a topic.
Then, you'll listen to a short lecture
related to the same topic.
And then you will have 20 minutes
to type your response at the computer.
There is no maximum length for your response,
but typically an effective response
has between 150 and 225 words.
Now let's look more closely
at what the Integrated Writing question is asking you to do.
First, you'll see the reading passage,
and you'll have 3 minutes to read it.
As you read, look for the main idea of the passage,
and take notes about key points that relate to that main idea.
You don't need to memorize the passage
because it will reappear on your screen when it is time to write.
Next, you will listen to a lecture.
The speaker will talk about the same topic
from a different perspective, for about 2 minutes.
As you listen, you can take notes on your scratch paper.
Listen for information
that responds to the points in the reading passage.
You will only hear the listening passage once.
And when it is finished, the reading passage
will reappear on your screen, along with the question.
And the question will always ask you to summarize the points
made in the lecture
and explain how they relate to specific points
in the reading passage.

♪ Music ♪
Now that you understand how the question is presented,
here are some strategies for what to do as you prepare
and write your response.
As we mentioned about the reading passage,
it's important to identify the main idea,
which is usually in the first paragraph,
and see how it's developed.
Usually there will be 3 points that support that main idea.
For this passage about computerized voting,
the main idea is stated in the first paragraph:
  it basically says that current voting systems
  are inaccurate and unreliable,
  and should be replaced by computerized voting systems.
You'll find the 3 supporting points in the next 3 paragraphs:
  Computerized voting would reduce the mistakes people make
  when they vote.
  It would reduce the mistakes people make
  when they count the votes.
  And it isn't any riskier than other widely-used
  electronic transactions, like in banking.
  In the listening passage, the speaker's going to indicate
  his or her perspective near the beginning of the lecture,
  so be sure to listen carefully.
  In this case, it's clear that the speaker
  opposes a change to electronic voting.
[Lecturer]: It's doubtful that computerized voting
will make the situation any better.
Then when you're taking notes during the listening passage,
remember that you're looking for specific points
that relate to the points in the reading.
[Lecturer]: ... These voters can easily cast the wrong vote
or be discouraged from voting altogether
because of fear of technology.
Furthermore, it's true that humans make mistakes
when they count up ballots by hand.
But are we sure that computers will do a better job?
After all, computers are programmed by humans,
so human error can show up in mistakes in their programs.
And in many voting systems,
there is no physical record of the votes,
so a computer recount
in the case of a suspected error is impossible.
As for our trust of computer technology
for banking and communications,
remember one thing:
  These systems are used daily, and they are used heavily.
  But voting happens only once every two years nationally
  in the United States,
  and not much more than twice a year in many local areas.
  This is hardly sufficient for us to develop confidence
  that computerized voting can be fully trusted.
  In this example, the speaker makes several points.
  So after you find those key points in the lecture,
  you may be able to match up those points
  with the main points from the reading
Finally, and this may sound obvious:
  make sure you answer the question.
  The question will always ask you to summarize the lecture,
  and it will always ask you how the lecture responds
  to the points made in the reading passage.
  So if you only write about what's in the reading passage,
  you're not answering the question.

  ETS® TOEFL® - Inside the TOEFL® Test

Michael: Hi, I'm Michael from ETS, and welcome to Inside the TOEFL test.

Michael: Today, we're going inside the TOEFL iBT writing section; specifically, question one, the Integrated Writing question. So, in the next few minutes we're going to look at how the question is structured, how to approach the question, how your response is scored. We'll look at a sample response that received a high score, and we'll give you some tips for improving your writing skills.

Skill-Building Tips
Michael: So, here's generally what question one will look like. For this task, you will first read a passage about a topic. Then, you'll listen to a short lecture related to the same topic. Then, you will have 20 minutes to type your response at the computer. There is no maximum length for your response, but typically an effective response has between 150 and 225 words.

  150 to 225 words
  Critics say that current voting systems used in the United States are inefficient and often lead to the inaccurate counting of votes. Miscounts can be especially damaging if an election is closely contested. Those critics would like the traditional systems to be replaced with far more efficient and trustworthy computerized voting systems.

In traditional voting, one major source of inaccuracy is that people accidentally vote for the wrong candidate. Voters usually have to find the name of their candidate on a large sheet of paper containing many names—the ballot—and make a small mark next to that name. People with poor eyesight can easily mark the wrong name. The computerized voting machines have an easy-to-use-touch-screen technology: to cast a vote, a voter needs only to touch the candidate; voters can even have the computer magnify the name for easier viewing.

Another major problem with old voting systems is that they rely heavily on people to count the votes. Officials must often count up the votes one by one, going through every ballot and recording the vote. Since they have to deal with thousands of ballots, it is almost inevitable that they will make mistakes. If an error is detected, a long and expensive recount has to take place. In contrast computerized systems remove the possibility of human error, since all the vote counting is done quickly and automatically by the computers.

Finally some people say it is too risky to implement complicated voting technology nationwide. But without giving it a thought, governments and individuals alike trust other complex computer technology every day to be perfectly accurate in banking transactions as well as in the communication of highly sensitive information.

Michael: Now, let's look more closely at what the Integrated Writing question is asking you to do.

On-screen: Reading Passage

3 minutes to read
look for the main idea
take notes on key points
don't need to memorize
Michael: First, you'll see the reading passage, and you'll have three minutes to read it. So, as you read, look for the main idea of the passage. Take notes about key points that relate to that main idea. You don't need to memorize the passage because it will reappear on your screen when it's time to write.

On-screen: Lecture

same topic, different perspective
2 minutes
take notes
listen for points that respond to the reading passage
Michael: Next, you'll listen to a lecture. The speaker will talk about the same topic from a different perspective for about two minutes. As you listen, you can take notes on your scratch paper. Listen for information that responds to the points in the reading passage.

On-screen:
  Summarize the points in the lecture
  Explain how they relate to specific points in the reading passage
Michael: You will only hear the listening passage once, and when it's finished the reading passage will reappear on your screen along with the question.  The question will always ask you to summarize the points made in the lecture and explain how they relate to specific points in the reading passage.

On-screen: Approach Tips

Michael: Now that you understand how the question is presented, here are some strategies for what to do as you prepare and write your response.

On-screen: Main idea
Current voting systems are inaccurate and unreliable. They should be replaced by computerized voting.
Michael: As we mentioned about the reading passage, it's important to identify the main idea, which is usually in the first paragraph, and see how it's developed. Usually, there will be three points that support that main idea.
Michael: For this passage about computerized voting, the main idea is stated in the first paragraph. It basically says that current voting systems are inaccurate and unreliable, and should be replaced by computerized voting systems.

On-screen: Supporting points
Computerized voting would reduce mistakes by people when they vote.
It would reduce mistakes people make when they count the votes.
Not any riskier than other common electronic transactions like banking.
Michael: You'll find the three supporting points in the next three paragraphs. Computerized voting would reduce the mistakes people make when they vote. It would reduce the mistakes people make when they count the votes, and it isn't any riskier than any other widely used electronic transactions like in banking.

In the listening passage, the speaker's going to indicate his or her perspective near the beginning of the lecture. So, be sure to listen carefully. In this case, it's clear that the speaker opposes a change to electronic voting.

On-screen:
  It's doubtful that computerized voting would solve the problems of voting.
Audio Example: It's doubtful that computerized voting will make the situation any better. [Audio fades out to background]

Michael: Then, when you're taking notes during the listening passage, remember you're looking for specific points that relate to the points in the reading.

Audio Example: These voters can easily cast the wrong vote or be discouraged from voting all together because of fear of technology. Furthermore, it's true that humans make mistakes when they count up ballots by hand, but are we sure that computers will do a better job? After all, computers are programmed by humans.  So, human error can show up in mistakes in their programs, and in many voting systems, there is no physical record of the votes. So, a computer recount in the case of a suspected error is impossible. As for our trust of computer technology for banking and communications, remember one thing, these systems are used daily and they are used heavily, but voting happens only once every two years nationally in the United States, and not much more than twice a year in many local areas. This is hardly sufficient for us to develop confidence that computerized voting can be fully trusted.

Michael: In this example, the speaker makes several points. So, after you find those key points in the lecture, you may be able to match up those points with the main points from the reading.

On-screen:
  People not familiar with computers can vote incorrectly or not at all if they are afraid of them.
  Computers can also make mistakes counting votes if programmed poorly.
  Computer voting systems don't have written records that can be checked.
  Computers for banking are used every day. Voting machines are used only once or twice a year.
On-screen: Answer the question!

Summarize the lecture
How the lecture responds to the points in the reading passage.
Michael: Finally, and this may sound obvious, make sure you answer the question. The question will always ask you to summarize the lecture and it will always ask you how the lecture responds to the points made in the reading passage. So, if you only write about what's in the reading passage, you're not answering the question.
On-screen: Scoring criteria

Michael: Before the test, make sure you understand what the raters are looking for and how each question is scored. The tasks in the writing section will each be given an overall score from zero to five.

On-screen: Accurate development
Michael: For question one, the Integrated Writing question, raters are looking for three main things – accurate development, organization and language use.

On-screen:

  How well you select important information from the lecture.
  How well you present it in relation to relevant information from the reading.
Michael: First, accurate development: The raters are looking for how well you're able to select important information from the lecture, then clearly present it in relation to the relevant information from the reading.

On-screen: Organization

Write in paragraphs
Use transitions
Avoid redundancy
Michael: Second, organization: This basically means the reader can read your essay from beginning to end without becoming confused. You can help the reader follow your ideas by writing in paragraphs and using good transitions; and avoid redundancy, which is saying the same things over and over, just using different words.

On-screen: Language use

Sentence structure
Word choice
Vocabulary
Use of grammar
Michael: The third criterion is language use. Raters are looking for things like sentence structure, word choice and vocabulary. It's also important that your use of grammar is strong and consistent, though it doesn't have to be perfect to get a top score.

On-screen: Sample response

Michael: Now, let's look at a sample response to this same question about computerized voting that received a score of five on a five-point scale. This response is very well organized and it does a very good job of selecting the important information from the points made in the lecture and explaining how the information relates to each of the claims made in the reading passage.

On-screen: Score of 5 on a 5-point scale

Well organized
Selects important information from the lecture
Explains how the points in the lecture relate to claims in the reading passage
Michael: First, it says that many voters are unfamiliar with computers. So, some voters may end up not voting at all, and this counters the argument that computerized voting is more user friendly and prevents the voting results from being distorted.

Second, it directly challenges the argument that computerized voting will result in fewer miscounts by saying that computer programming errors could results in even larger miscount or the loss of voting records. 

Third, it rejects the idea that computerized voting would be similar to computerized banking by pointing out that the computerized banking is only reliable because it is so frequently used, and that does not apply to voting.

On-screen: Score of 5 on a 5-point scale

Michael: So, overall, the response is well organized, and it shows the writer really understands how to explain the ways in which one source disagrees with another. There are occasional minor language errors like "Some people are not used of computers," instead of "Some people are not used to computers," and making "miscounted" two words instead of one, but there aren't very many of these kinds of errors. Most important, they don't make the content of the response unclear or inaccurate. So, this response would receive the highest score of five out of five. It's a good example of how your response doesn't have to be perfect to get a high score. For more details about scoring this type of question, look at the Integrated Writing Rubrics.

On-screen: Skill-Building Tips
Practice paraphrasing, which is expressing the same idea in different ways

Michael: Now here are a few tips that can help you improve your writing skills. First, practice paraphrasing, which is expressing the same idea in different ways. Knowing how to paraphrase is important because it gives you more options when you need to respond to a question. You can practice paraphrasing just about anything — a news article, a television ad, an email from a friend, a poem, basically anything you read or hear.

On-screen: Build your vocabulary
Practice using synonyms when you write.

Michael: To be able to paraphrase well and to write well, you need to build your vocabulary. It's important to be able to use synonyms of key words when you write.

On-screen: Practice identifying main points
Listen to recorded lectures and write down the main points.

Michael: Next, remember how we said it was important to be able to identify main points? You can practice this by listening to recorded lectures and writing down what the main points are. This is a great activity to do with a study partner because you can compare notes.

On-screen:
  Read two articles on the same topic and write a summary of each.
  Explain ways they are similar and ways they are different.

Michael: Here's another tip: Read two articles that are on the same topic, and write a summary of each. Then, explain the ways in which they are similar and the ways that they're different.

On-screen: ETS TOEFL® Writing Question 1

Michael: There are lots of ways to improve your English skills. Whatever you do, keep practicing and good luck on your TOEFL test.

Independent Writing Question 2
In the Independent Writing task, you are presented with a question that asks you to give your opinion on an issue.

♪ Music ♪
So here's generally what question 2 will look like.
For this task, you are presented with a question,
and you have 30 minutes to type your response at the computer.
There is no maximum length for your essay,
but a good response is usually at least 300 words.
So, what is the question asking you to do?
The independent writing question
will ask your opinion on an issue,
so often you will get a question such as:
  Do you agree or disagree?
  Which would you prefer?
  or Do you support or oppose this idea?
  Regardless of the question,
  you will be expected to use specific reasons and examples
  to support your answer.
  Let's look at some sample topics.
  Number 1.
  Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?
  A teacher's ability to relate well with students
  is more important
  than excellent knowledge of the subject being taught.
  2. Some people like to travel with a companion.
  Other people prefer to travel alone.
  Which do you prefer?
  3. It has recently been announced
  that a new restaurant may be built in your neighborhood.
  Do you support or oppose this plan?
  ♪ Music ♪

Independent Writing Question 2: Approach Tips 

  One way to approach your essay is to make an outline.
  Here's how you might make an outline to answer the question
  about traveling alone or with a companion.
  First, decide which option you prefer.
  Let's say you prefer to travel with a companion.
  Then, think of the main reasons why you have that preference,
  such as, it's safer, it's more fun, and it makes travel easier.
  Then list some specific examples for each reason.
  Using an organizing tool like an outline
  is important when planning your essay.
  Don't try to create an essay
  by memorizing paragraphs on various topics before the test
  and then trying to relate them to the topic you receive,
  because the content won't be appropriate,
  and you'll just receive a low score.

Score of 4 on a 5-point scale
Writer’s point of view
Michael: Now, let's look at a sample response to give you an idea of what a good essay looks like and what our raters look for when they score. This essay was responding to the topic about teachers. It received a score of four on a five-point scale. This essay has a very traditional structure. It gives the writer's point of view in the first paragraph, and then has three paragraphs of supporting points and then a concluding paragraph.

Michael: The writer's first supporting point is that relating to students is a job of a counselor, not a teacher, and that teachers without content knowledge are simply not good teachers. The point is a good one and generally well stated.

The second point is that students want to take courses from teachers with special knowledge, even if the teachers are not entertaining. This is another good point.

The third point is interesting, but it has some weaknesses in the writing. The writer talks about how teachers have the obligation to pass on what they have learned, but there are some errors of word choice like "conceding their knowledge" and "advantaged education", and the connection of ideas is somewhat unclear. For example, what's the purpose of saying, "We all learn because we want to become the better person that this world needs."

On-screen: Sample Response

Score of 4 on a 5-point scale
Michael: So, overall, the essay is well organized and makes solid points, but given the word choice and unclear connection of ideas, especially in the fourth paragraph, this essay would receive a score of four out of five.

 Test: Question Type1 NarratorNow listen to part of a lecture on the topic you just read about.ProfessorOffering employees the option of a four-day workweek won’t affect company profits, economic conditions, or the lives of employees in the ways the reading suggests.First, offering a four-day workweek will probably force companies to spend more—possibly a lot more. Adding new workers means putting much more money into providing training and medical benefits; remember ... the costs of things like health benefits can be the same whether an employee works four days or five. And having more employees also requires more office space and more computers. These additional costs would quickly cut into company profits.Second, with respect to overall employment, it doesn’t follow that once some employees choose a four-day workweek, many more jobs will become available. Hiring new workers is costly, as I argued a moment ago. And companies have other options: they might just choose to asktheir employees to work overtime to make up the difference. Worse, companies might raise expectations ... they might start to expect that their four-day employees can do the same amount of work they used to do in five days. If this happens, then no additional jobs will be created and current jobs will become more unpleasant.Finally, while a four-day workweek offers employees more free time to invest in their personal lives, it also presents some risks that could end up reducing their quality of life. Working a shorter week can decrease employees’ job stability and harm their chances for advancing their careers. Four-day employees are likely to be the first to lose their jobs during an economic downturn. They may also be passed over for promotions because companies might prefer to have five-day employees in management positions to ensure continuous coverage and consistent supervision for the entire workweek.
