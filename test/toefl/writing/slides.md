About the Writing Section
The fourth and last section of the TOEFL iBT®  test is the Writing section.

The Writing section has two essay questions and takes 50 minutes to complete.

Question 1 is the Integrated Writing question. For this question, you will read a passage and listen to a short lecture before writing your response. You will have 20 minutes to write your response.

Question 2 is the Independent Writing question. For this question, you will give your opinion on an issue. You will have 30 minutes to write your response.

The Writing section is scored on a scale from 0-30.

You will learn more details about the Writing section this week through a series of videos about the two Writing question types.


Integrated Writing Question 1: Overview
In the Integrated Writing task, you will read a passage about an academic topic for about 3 minutes. Then you will hear a short lecture related to the topic. You will then be asked to summarize the points in the lecture and explain how they relate to points in the reading passage.

Watch the following Inside the TOEFL® Test video to learn more about how the question is structured.

 
For the 20-minute Integrated task, spend most of your time summarizing relevant lecture content—that is, lecture content that addresses points made in the reading. Referencing the reading is important, but the main task is to summarize the lecture in relation to the reading. Save time organizing your response by simply following the order of the lecture’s points.

While responding to this Writing task, keep track of the time. Try to finish writing your essay by the time the clock has counted down to 4 or 5 minutes. Use the remaining time to check your work and make final changes.

Independent Writing Question 2
In the Independent Writing task, you are presented with a question that asks you to give your opinion on an issue.

Managing Your Time
For the 30-minute Independent task, first think about what you want to say. Decide what major points you will make and jot them down in a logical order. This pre-writing can save you time by providing substance and direction for your writing. As you write, stay focused on giving appropriate reasons, examples, and details.

While responding to this Writing task, keep track of the time. Try to finish writing your essay by the time the clock has counted down to 4 or 5 minutes. Use the remaining time to check your work and make final changes.


Writing Rubrics
The Writing tasks are scored on a scale of 0-5 using a rubric, or scoring guide. The rubric describes the characteristics of a written response at each score level so that the rater can assign the appropriate score.

The rubrics for the Integrated question and the Independent question are similar. Both evaluate your writing in terms of development, organization, and language use. Some of the details vary because of the differences in the question types.

You can view the Writing rubrics here: Writing Rubrics(opens new window)
https://www.ets.org/s/toefl/pdf/toefl_writing_rubrics.pdf

These are exactly the same rubrics that ETS raters use when scoring writing tasks. There is not a “public version” and a “rater version” of the rubrics, like some other tests have.

If you are working with an English teacher, you can ask him or her to help evaluate your practice responses using these rubrics.

ETS Practice Test (External resource)
This section measures your ability to write in English to communicate in an academic environment.

There are two questions in this practice test.

For Question 1, you will read a passage and listen to a lecture about the same topic. You may take notes while you read and listen. Then you will write a response to a question based on what you have read and heard. You may look back at the passage when answering the question. You may use your notes to help you answer the question. (Your notes will not be scored on the TOEFL® test.) You have 20 minutes to plan and write your response.

For Question 2, you will write an essay based on your own knowledge and experience. You have 30 minutes to plan and complete your essay.

This practice test uses an automated scoring tool that allows you to submit your Writing responses for electronic scoring by ETS. See the system requirements below.

For each question, after you read and/or listen to all parts of the question, start the timer by selecting BEGIN, and type your essay in the box provided. When you have competed your essay, select SUBMIT to send it for scoring. Please note that responses for each question can only be submitted one time.

After you have submitted both responses, they will be scored. You will receive a scaled score range within 24 hours of submitting your last response.

Your scaled score does not count toward your course grade. You will get credit for your responses when you answer “yes” to the question about completing those activities in Writing Quiz 5.

Please note:
The practice questions are real TOEFL iBT® test questions, but the testing experience has been adapted for this course. For example:

Although you are able to control the audio passage in this practice test, in the real test, you will only hear the audio passage once, without pauses.
A transcript of the lecture is available in this practice test, but not on the actual test.
In this practice test, you can start the timer for each essay. In the real test, the timer will start automatically and cannot be controlled by the test taker.
Your performance on this practice test is not a predictor of how you might perform on the actual TOEFL iBT test.

Scaled score ranges and scoring information are for preparation use only; they are not official scores.

System Requirements

Writing Question 1
Directions: Give yourself 3 minutes to read the passage. Then play the audio.

In the United States, employees typically work five days a week for eight hours each day. However, many employees want to work a four-day week and are willing to accept less pay in order to do so. A mandatory policy requiring companies to offer their employees the option of working a four-day workweek for four-fifths (80 percent) of their normal pay would benefit the economy as a whole as well as the individual companies and the employees who decided to take the option.

The shortened workweek would increase company profits because employees would feel more rested and alert, and as a result, they would make fewer costly errors in their work. Hiring more staff to ensure that the same amount of work would be accomplished would not result in additional payroll costs because four-day employees would only be paid 80 percent of the normal rate. In the end, companies would have fewer overworked and error-prone employees for the same money, which would increase company profits.

For the country as a whole, one of the primary benefits of offering this option to employees is that it would reduce unemployment rates. If many full-time employees started working fewer hours, some of their workload would have to be shifted to others. Thus, for every four employees who went on an 80 percent week, a new employee could be hired at the 80 percent rate.

Finally, the option of a four-day workweek would be better for individual employees. Employees who could afford a lower salary in exchange for more free time could improve the quality of their lives by spending the extra time with their families, pursuing private interests, or enjoying leisure activities.

Writing Question 2
Directions: Read the question below. You have 30 minutes to plan, write, and revise your essay. Typically, an effective response will contain a minimum of 300 words.

 Response Time: 00:30:00
 Question: Do you agree or disagree with the following statement?

 People benefit more from traveling in their own country than from traveling to foreign countries.

 Use specific reasons and examples to support your answer. Be sure to use your own words. Do not use memorized examples.

A Message from Shawn

 Hello everyone.

 By now you should have submitted your responses to the two Writing questions that were assigned in the previous unit.

 One was the Integrated Writing question; where you read a passage and listened to a lecture, then wrote about how the lecture relates to the reading.

 The other was the Independent Writing question that asked about your opinion on a topic.

 The responses are scored by our automated scoring engine called e-rater, which looks for key characteristics in your writing and assigns a score. This can give you some idea of how your responses would be scored on the real test.

 In this unit, you will see some additional sample responses and their scores, with comments from the raters about why they received those scores.

 Keep up the great work!

 --Shawn

Sample Responses - Question 1

Let's Review:

Below are topic notes that are important to include when answering Question 1, followed by sample responses and comments from real TOEFL raters. If you need to review Question 1, go to the bottom of the page.

Topic Notes:

You should understand the reasons presented in the lecture for why offering a four-day workweek is not necessarily a good idea. The lecturer questions each of the benefits of a four-day workweek presented in the reading passage: benefits to companies, to the country as a whole, as well as to individuals.

A high-scoring response will include the following points made by the lecturer that address the points made in the reading passage:

Point Made in the Reading Passage

Contrasting Point from the Lecture

Companies will profit from four-day workers because these workers will be more alert and make fewer mistakes in their work.

Company profits could actually decrease due to extra money companies will need to spend on health benefits, training, space, or equipment for extra workers.

A policy of having four-day workers opens up more jobs and could reduce unemployment nationwide.

Unemployment may not decrease because companies could just ask workers to work overtime, or expect four-day workers to complete five days of work in four days.

The extra day off would improve individuals’ quality of life by allowing them more time with family and more leisure time.

The quality of life of people working four-day weeks could suffer because they could have fewer chances for career advancement or be more likely to be laid off.

 

Sample Responses:
Here are responses from PAbreu from Portugal and Mariana from Venezuela. Let’s take a look at their responses together!

Annotate

Read PAbreu’s high-level response.

In the lecture, the professor makes a series of points that cast doubt on all the arguments presented in the reading passages about the advantages of a four-day workweek.

First of all, the professor does not believe that offering the four-day workweek to the employees will not have an impact on the company's profits. In fact, the professor argues that it is very unlikely that profits will increase, being much more probable that they will actually decrease. This decrease in profits would occur due to an increase in expenses that would follow the adoption of this workweek scheme by the employees. If the company has to contract new employees, it necessarily has to spend more in training, medical assistance, and maybe even in the expansion of the office and buying of new equipment to accommodate them.

Secondly, and taking into account all the expenses that can come from hiring new employees, as just explained, the professor does not think that there would be a reduction of unemployment rates (as suggested in the reading passage) as it is very likely that companies would opt for alternatives that do not bring new costs. These options might include asking the employees to work overtime to compensate for the hours lost or raising the expectations to the employee having the four-day workweek, i.e., assuming that the employee will do in this time the same amount of work we used to do on the five-day workweek.

Finally, even though the professor recognizes that having more free time could improve the quality of life of the individual employees, as stated in the reading passage, he does not think that those benefits would come without risks. According to the professor, the employees that opt for the four-day workweek would be the firsts to be fired if the company needs to reduce the costs and would less likely progress in their careers, since companies prefer to give high responsibility positions to employees that are committed to their work and are available for the required duties for longer periods of time.

Rater Comments:

In this high-level response, PAbreu successfully selects the important information in the lecture and clearly explains how this information casts doubt on the reading. The response is well-organized: Each paragraph in the body of the essay begins by establishing that the lecturer disagrees with one of the reading’s claims about a four-day workweek; it then presents, in a clear and orderly way, the lecturer’s reasons for disagreeing. The response contains some occasional language errors: In the last sentence of paragraph 3, PAbreu uses the pronoun “to” instead of “for” in the phrase “expectations to the employee”; towards the end of the same sentence, the pronoun “we” is used instead of “he” or “she” to refer back to "employee"; and in the last sentence of paragraph 4, PAbreu refers to “employees that opt for the four-day workweek” as “the firsts to be fired…”, incorrectly making “first” plural instead of using the phrase “first ones”. But these minor errors do not prevent a reader from understanding the content or the connections PAbreu is trying to make.

Read Mariana’s high-level response.

The lecture talks about the negative points regarding the installment of a four-day work week in American work places.

He begins the lecture by stating that, despite the fact that workers with a shortened workweek will be given a smaller salary, companies will lose money if this new policy were instated. Because several employees would work less, they would probably require more workers; which would be costly for the company, as they would have to pay for things such as medical insurance, or augment the office spaces to accommodate more people. These extra costs would quite easily cut into the company's profits, and not be beneficial.

The teacher argues that, unlike what is suggested in the reading, the idea of a four day week will not increase employment spaces. On the other hand, he feels that companies will most likely expect employees with a shortened workweek to do the same amount of work in four days that they used to do in five. Because of that workers will have to endure much more stress and working conditions would be more unpleasant.

Lastly, he does agree with the reading regarding the fact that a four day week would give employees more time with personal matters, such as family or recreational activities. However, he also finds a downside to this when he explains that working only four days would make the employee less likely to gain considerable promotions in their work fields. Also, he says that in the case of an economic downfall, four day workers would be the first to be fired. In conclusion, despite the positive points made in the reading, it can be said that the teacher is against the idea of a four day week and has several valid arguments to support his position.

Rater Comments:

In this high-level response, the writer generally does a good job of selecting the relevant information from the lecture, and she is fairly good at presenting it clearly. The writer’s response is somewhat incomplete in covering the lecture’s second point; the writer mentions only one of the two ways that companies may try to avoid the cost of hiring additional staff. Similarly, in covering the lecture’s third point (about 4-day employees being passed over for promotions), the writer leaves out some information; she does not give the professor’s explanation for why this might occur. There is some minor vagueness in the writer’s use of the phrase “will not increase employment spaces”; the phrase could be taken to mean literal work “spaces” at company facilities as opposed to increased employment opportunities more generally. There are hardly any language or usage errors; the transitional phrase “On the other hand” in paragraph 3 is ill-chosen (“On the contrary” was probably intended). Commas are used here and there when they shouldn’t be or omitted where they are needed, but these usage errors are minor and do not affect the writer’s overall presentation.

Sample Responses - Question 2
Let's Review:

Below are topic notes that are important to include when answering Question 2, followed by sample responses and comments from real TOEFL raters. If you need to review Question 2, go to the bottom of the page.

Topic Notes:

The topic is accessible; writers generally have plenty to say in response to this prompt. Not surprisingly, many respond that both traveling in one's own country and traveling to a foreign country are good. Travel, in general, provides new experiences and opportunities to see and learn about new people and places. People grow through traveling.

Those who agree with the prompt say that if there is a good place to go in your country, by all means, go there. Domestic travel is not expensive, and it is comfortable, convenient, and easy. One doesn't need any foreign language skills to travel in one’s own country. Different cultures, places, and languages may not provide the relaxation that one wants from a vacation.

Those who say they prefer travel to foreign places cite the usual reasons: that travel is broadening and one can learn about a different culture. In these days of globalization it is important to know about the world, not just one's own country. Writers cite particular cities and countries as specific examples although many of the essays are more general than specific.

A few writers talk about travel in terms of emigration/immigration from one country to another. Since the prompt does not specify the reason for travel, these are considered on topic and are scored accordingly.

 

Your Responses:
We have selected responses from Aarcha Z. from Norway and Chao from China. Let’s take a look at their responses together!


Read Aarcha Z’s high-level response.

I think that people benefit more from traveling to foreign countries. I travel to experience new sights, cultures and food. How can you do that if you just travel in your own country? You have to go to South America to see the great work that Native Americans made centuries ago, to Spain to be greeted with the Spaniards’ hospitality and to Japan to eat authentic Japanese-style barbecued eel. By travelling in your own country, you won’t experience anything new – you’ll still see the things you’re used to see, be in the same culture as your own and eat the same things you always eat.

In addition to that, travelling to another country gives you the perfect excuse to learn a new language. For example, I’m planning to go to France next year, and I’ve already started learning basic French with the help of apps on my mobile phone. Learning a new language is a wonderful thing, as it not only helps you get around in foreign countries, but also makes you attractive in the job market. If you’re travelling in your own country, you will never truly need to learn a new language, and will therefore miss out on the opportunity that it brings.

One of my favorite things to do when I’m travelling is to go shopping – and nothing is more fun than to shop in foreign countries. I’m not saying that you won’t be able to shop if you’re travelling in your own country. What I am saying is that you’ll be able to buy things abroad that you won’t be able to buy back home. For instance, when I was in Japan I bought a beautiful necklace made from a rare black pearl. I wouldn’t have been able to buy it if I never went to Japan!

To conclude, I would like to say that I disagree with the statement. People benefit more from travelling to foreign countries than from travelling in their own country. This is because one will be able to experience new things, learn new languages and buy exclusive items when travelling abroad.

Rater Comments:

In a sometimes lively and vivid way, this high-level response effectively addresses the topic by describing three benefits of foreign travel, contrasting them throughout with the limitations of traveling in one’s own country. The essay is generally well organized and unified, consistently developing the idea that traveling in foreign countries offers opportunities you can’t get in your home country: the opportunity to experience new places, to learn a foreign language, to buy things you won’t find elsewhere. The examples provided are appropriate and occasionally made memorable by the use of striking and specific details, such as when Aarcha mentions eating “authentic Japanese-style barbecued eel” and purchasing a “beautiful necklace made from a rare black pearl”. Aarcha’s language facility is generally good and displays some syntactic variety: In paragraph 1, Aarcha follows a short rhetorical question with a long sentence listing cultural experiences specific to certain countries. The response contains only one or two noticeable minor errors in word form; “you’ll still see the things you’re used to see”, for example, should read “you’ll still see the things you’re used to seeing”

Read Chao’s high-level response.

When it comes to the question whether it's more beneficial to travel internationally or domestically, everyone will have their own answer given their individual characteristics such as their needs, interests, and budget. From my perspective, given same amount of travel time and budget, I deem I can benefit more from travelling in my own countries. I will detail my reasoning as follows.
 
 The most critical reason is time. As a traveler, I would prefer spending more time exploring my destination rather than getting stuck at the security checkpoint, sitting in the airplane, and waiting in a long queue at the custom, which are often associated with international travel. For example, if I have a week of vacation, instead of spending 2 days on the way, I could choose a destination that may only take me couple hours to get there that means I have 1 more extra vacation day.
  
  Secondly, more time at the destination enables me to explore and interact with the people and surroundings more. I personally prefer a more in depth traveling experience than a superficial glance of tourist attractions. International trip is often meticulously organized because of the language barriers. In comparison, as I travel in my own country, I can freely tour around my destination, chatting to local people, enjoy the street food that makes the trip a lot more interesting.
   
   Lastly, international travel can cost travelers significantly more comparing to a domestic one. Admittedly, cost of a trip is often determined personal choice and preference but a lot fees, such as visa and currency exchange, are often inevitable. In addition, to save money in another unknown country can be a lot more challenging.
    
    In all, despite the fact that international travel may leave me an exciting memory, as a traveler I feel I benefit more from traveling within the country when considering time, money and travel experience.

    Rater Comments:

    In this high-level response, the writer addresses the topic and task well, developing well-chosen comparisons between international and domestic travel to organize the response and defend a preference for domestic travel. The writer generally supports each point with appropriate examples and explanations. In explaining the time-saving value of domestic travel, the writer vividly describes the frustrations and delays of international travel, including the examples of “getting stuck at the security checkpoint, sitting in the airplane, and waiting in a long queue at the custom”. The writer also employs a variety of sentence structures and accurately uses a range of vocabulary, such as “meticulously”, “superficial”, and “admittedly”. There are some minor language errors, several of which involve the omission of words (“given [the] same amount”, “take me [a] couple [of] hours”, “often determined [by] personal choice”), but these do not interfere with meaning.
