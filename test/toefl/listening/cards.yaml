            Professor:

                So for small mammals, microclimates can 
                make a big difference--they rely on 
                microclimates for survival.

            Student:

                So cold-blooded animals, like reptiles--
                they can't control their own body 
                temperature, so I can imagine the effect a 
                microclimate would have on them ...
