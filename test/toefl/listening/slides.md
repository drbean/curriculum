About the Listening Section


The second section of the TOEFL iBT® test is the Listening section.

This section contains two types of listening materials: conversations and lectures. Both are based on the actual speech that is used at universities in which English is the language of instruction. Along with accents from North America, you may hear accents from the U.K. and Australia.

This section contains either 2 conversations and 3 lectures or 3 conversations and 4 lectures. You will hear them only one time each.

The conversations are typical of those that occur on university campuses in which English is the primary language spoken. For example, there may be a conversation between a student and a professor about course requirements or the content of a lecture. There may also be a conversation between a student and a university staff member about nonacademic matters, such as registering for a class or paying for housing.

Each conversation is about 3 minutes long and has 5 multiple-choice questions. You will not be able to see the questions while you listen to the conversations. 

The lectures represent the kind of language used when professors teach in a classroom. The content of the lectures reflects the content that is presented in introductory-level university courses.

Lectures cover a broad range of subjects and topics. Here are a few examples:
•Arts: architecture, music history, literature, ceramics, art history
•Life Science: botany, animal behavior, nutrition, aquatic organisms
•Physical Science: weather, astronomy, pollution, technology, geology
•Social Science: anthropology, business, child development, history



You will not be expected to have prior knowledge of the subject matter. The information you need to answer the questions will be contained in the lecture.

Each lecture is about 5 minutes long and has 6 multiple-choice questions. Just as with the conversations, you will not be able to see the questions while you listen to the lectures.

You will have 41 to 57 minutes to complete the Listening section. During that time, you cannot return to previous questions to review or change your answers. The questions must be answered in the order they are presented.


You will learn more details about the Listening section this week through a series of videos. The first video explains how to approach a listening passage. It will be followed by several other videos about the different Listening question types.

Additional Points and Tips


Here are a few additional points about Listening passages, and tips about how to approach them. –Insook

Visuals in Lectures

Lectures have more content than conversations, so there is some additional support for you as a listener. 

In some of the lectures, words may be presented on the screen as if written on a chalkboard. These words will be the kinds of terms or proper names that a professor might write down for the class while giving a lecture, like this:

Sometimes a content visual will appear as it would if the class were looking at an illustration in a textbook or on a screen, like this illustration of a chromosome:

Interactive Lectures 

In some of the lectures, the professor is the only speaker. In others, students make comments or ask questions. In the case of these interactive lectures, you may be asked about what a student said or about a student’s attitude or opinion. You may also be asked about the professor’s attitude or opinion. So it’s important to listen for all of the attitudes and opinions expressed as well as for the facts and ideas presented.   

Do Key Points Support the Main Idea?

Sometimes the key support for the main idea is quite obvious. The professor may make a statement that is the main idea of the lecture. Then she may list two or three reasons why that statement is true, elaborating on each one. Each reason could be a supporting point that is tested in a listening lecture. 

But be careful: Not all of the key points will be directly related to the main point or purpose. They may be a well-developed sub-topic or an aside. 

The same is true of conversations. Here’s an example: in a conversation, a student may complain to the resident advisor about the trouble he has sleeping at night. He explains that his roommate plays music late at night and the students in the next room talk loudly until midnight. The resident advisor may offer concrete suggestions on how to deal with the situation. These concrete suggestions would be directly related to the main point—they directly address the problem the student is having.  

But maybe instead, the resident advisor gives an illustration of how she solved a similar problem with her roommate in the past. You might be asked a question about why the resident advisor tells the story about her roommate. She tells this story as an illustration of how the man might approach the problem he has. In this case, the resident advisor’s story is a well-developed aside. It does not directly address the student’s problem, but it is related to addressing the problem. You need to be able to follow the conversation and see how the ideas presented relate to each other.

Also, remember that often, when a TOEFL® speaker wants you to pay close attention to what she is going to say, she will give you a signal, just as she might do in a regular classroom or in any campus setting. She might say something like “Think about this.” Speakers can also give a signal by speaking a little louder or a little slower, for emphasis. You should also assume that a detail is important if the speaker uses it as an example of something, in which case she might say “for example” or “for instance.”

Taking Notes 

As you practice for the TOEFL iBT® Listening section on your own, start out by listening twice to each practice lecture and taking notes. Your notes should be brief; don’t try to write down everything you hear. The first time through, take notes on the main idea and key supporting points for that idea. The second time you listen, try to fill in more of the supporting details in your notes, paying attention to how the ideas connect with one another. Remember that in the real TOEFL iBT test you will hear the lecture only once, so you will also need to practice taking notes on lectures while listening just once. See if taking notes helps you answer the questions or not. Some test takers find that taking notes is helpful, but others find that they miss too much of the lecture while trying to take notes. Determine which approach works best for you.


Managing Your Time

Many test takers want to know how much time they should take to answer the questions in the Listening section of the TOEFL® test. A good pace is about 30 seconds per question (two questions per minute).

Listening to Academic Materials

The more listening you do in English, the easier it will be for you to follow conversations and lectures in English, including those on the TOEFL iBT test. So listen to academic material in English as much as you can—radio and TV broadcasts, podcasts, documentaries, and audio books. If you want to improve the ease with which you can process material you hear in English, increase the amount of time you spend listening to academic material in English. 

Listening Practice Test Directions


This section measures your ability to understand conversations and lectures in English.

This practice test contains one conversation and two lectures. Listen to the conversation and lectures only one time. After each conversation and lecture, you will answer some questions about it. Answer each question based on what is stated or implied by the speakers.

On test day, you may take notes while you listen and you may use your notes to help you answer the questions. Your notes will not be scored.

In some questions you will see this icon: Headphones This means you will hear, but not see, the question.

Answer each question before moving on. Do not return to previous questions.

It will take about 30 minutes to listen to the conversation and lectures and answer the questions about them.

Please note:


The practice questions are real TOEFL iBT® test questions, but the testing experience has been adapted for presentation in this course. For example: 
•Although you are able to control the audio passages in this practice test, in the real test you will only hear audio passages once, without pauses. 
•Transcripts of conversations and lectures are available in this practice test, but not on the actual test.

Your performance on this practice test is not a predictor of how you might perform on the actual TOEFL iBT® test. 

Your scores for this practice test will show correct vs. incorrect choices. You will also see an explanation for why each answer choice is correct or incorrect. Scores and scoring information are for preparation use only; they are not official or scaled scores. 

4: Practice
Pick two of the following activities and complete them on your own. Most of these activities are based on the tips presented in the Inside the TOEFL® Test videos (the links will take you outside of the course and the edX platform).

1.    Find a friend or study partner, and listen to a short audio clip, like this one about butterflies(http://www.smithsonianmag.com/videos/category/science/butterflies-zigzag-wildly-for-a-reason/) from Smithsonian.com. When it’s finished, each of you should write down as much as you can remember about what you heard. Then compare notes to see who remembered more of the important points and supporting details.

2.    Listen to a podcast that has several speakers, like those from the TED® Radio Hour(http://www.npr.org/podcasts/510298/ted-radio-hour). Ask yourself what each speaker is really trying to accomplish by saying certain things. The speaker may be trying to do things like:

·         Direct

·         Recommend

·         Complain

·         Agree/Disagree

·         Question

·         Confirm

3.    Listen to a recording of a classic story from English literature, like this excerpt from a Sherlock Holmes mystery story(https://www.englishclub.com/efl/podcasts/classics/sherlock-holmes/). Stop the recording at various points, and try to summarize what has been said. Then try to predict what will be said next.

4.    Find academic lectures in introductory online university courses, like the courses offered by edX(https://www.edx.org). Listen to 3 or 4 lectures of increasing length, starting with topics that you are familiar with, and building up to longer ones on topics that are not familiar to you. Listen to them multiple times if you need to, and identify the main idea and the speaker’s purpose for each.

5.    When you listen to conversations or lectures, try to predict what kinds of questions will be asked, as well as what the answers to those questions will be. The more you practice predicting what questions will be asked, the better you will get at predicting and the better you will get at listening for important information. This will help you improve your confidence about taking the Listening section of the test, as you realize you know what to expect, and what to listen for!
