Challenges of Listening: Listening and You


♪ Music ♪


- Hi, I'm Insook, your TOEFL Listening instructor


for this week.


To be successful in your academic studies,


you will probably need to do things like


follow a conversation, recognize attitudes and opinions,


and understand the class lecture.


Learning to listen in an academic setting


can be challenging.


Don't worry, we're here to help you familiarize yourself


with the listening skills required


and how they are measured on the TOEFL Test.


This week, we will provide you with a lot of information


to help you build your listening skills.


We spoke to a few students just like you


about their concerns, challenges, and successes


as they learned to listen to English.


- [Voiceover] I can understand English quite well


when I read, but sometimes I can't understand


everyday conversations in English.


What should I do?


- [Voiceover] When I listen to a talk in English,


it seems as if the speaker goes very fast.


It's hard to keep up with what they are saying,


and to not get distracted


if I don't understand some of the words.


- [Voiceover] Slowly and slowly, the more news I listen,


and the more movies I watch, it was easier for me.


- [Voiceover] Oh, when I listen to English


I find it difficult to understand different accents,


depending on who the speakers are.


- [Voiceover] So, to improve my listening,


I started watching American TV shows, and


the subtitles really helped too.


If I don't understand, I look at the subtitles


and then I learned how to say it.


- [Voiceover] I used to have trouble concentrating


when I listened to lectures,


but now I take some notes to stay focused while I listen


and to remember important details.


- [Voiceover] I think it's a challenge in listening,


because we don't really know the context


and we have to really process information fast


to understand what's going on.


- Let's address some of the concerns you have


about listening by preparing


for the TOEFL Listening Section together.


This week, we're going to take a deeper look


at this section of the TOEFL iBT Test.


First, we will discuss the two basic types


of listening passages you will hear on the test.


Then, we will go over the question types


that you will see on the test.


We will also provide you with tips


on how to improve your listening skills.


And then, we will give you a chance


to practice answering questions.


Let's get started.

2: How to Approach a TOEFL iBT® Listening Passage

♪ Music ♪


- Let's talk about how to approach a TOEFL iBT


listening passage.


To get you prepared for test day.


There are two kinds of listening passages.


conversations and lectures.


For both conversations and lectures,


the first thing you need to do as a listener


is to get oriented.


The image on the screen and the narrator's words


will help you figure out what the situation is.


Conversations always start with a statement


that tells you who the speakers are.


For example, you will see this photo of the speakers


and hear the narrator say something like,


"Listen to a conversation between a student


and an employee at the university career center."


This introductory line from the narrator


lets you know where the conversation is taking place,


and it helps you make some initial predictions


about the content of the conversation.


For a lecture, you will first see an image


indicating the basic subject area of the lecture.


For example, geology.


In this case, you would hear the words,


"Listen to part of the lecture in the geology class."


This introduction will help you get ready


to listen to a topic in geology.


As you listen to both conversations


and lectures, your goal will be to identify three things.


First, the main idea or purpose of the conversation.


Second, key points that the speakers make


to develop that main idea,


or the points they make to achieve their goal.


And, third, the attitudes or opinions


that the speakers express.


You may find it helpful to take notes


on the key points as you listen.


But don't try to write down everything you hear.


Some of the best advice I can give you


is to make an effort to keep listening


to the lecture, even if you miss a name,


or a number, or a fact.


The questions will not be about insignificant details.


They're about the important ideas and details


that support the main points.


Often the term you may not know


will become clear in the context of the lecture.


So train yourself to keep listening


and not to worry about an unfamiliar term


or a detail you missed.


So remember, get yourself oriented.


Listen for the main idea and key points.


Listen for attitudes and opinions.


And keep listening, even if you miss something.


If you can do these things


you will become more successful


at the TOEFL iBT listening tasks.

[♪MUSIC♪]


MICHAEL: Hi, I'm Michael from ETS.


Today on Inside the TOEFL Test,


we're going inside the TOEFL iBT Listening section.


Specifically, the Gist-content and Gist-purpose questions.


The gist of something is the main point or key idea.


In the TOEFL iBT test, Gist-content questions


ask you to identify the main topic


or idea of the listening conversation or lecture.


Gist-purpose questions ask you to identify


what the main purpose of the conversation or lecture is.


You can recognize Gist-content and Gist-purpose questions


because they use phrases like


"mainly about," "mainly discussing,"


"why does the student" or "what is the main purpose."


Here are two things to keep in mind when answering Gist-content


and Gist-purpose questions:


In the Listening section,


there will always be either a Gist-content question


or a Gist-purpose question, but never both.


This question will always be the first question


after listening to the passage.


Also, sometimes the lectures and conversations


can have 2 main ideas.


In this case, the Gist-content


or Gist-purpose question may ask you


to choose 2 of the 4 answer options, instead of just one.


Let's look at some sample Gist-content


and Gist-purpose questions.


First we'll listen to part of a conversation


between a coach and a student catching up on what happened


while the student was away.


MALE COACH: Hi, Elizabeth.


FEMALE STUDENT: Hey, Coach.


I just thought I'd stop by to see what I missed


while I was gone.


MALE COACH: Well, we've been working real hard on our plan


for the next game ...


I've asked Susan to go over it with you


before practice this afternoon, so you'll know what we're doing.


FEMALE STUDENT: Okay.


MALE COACH: By the way, how did your brother's wedding go?


FEMALE STUDENT: Oh, it was beautiful.


And the whole family was there.


I saw aunts and uncles and cousins I hadn't seen in years.


MALE COACH: So it was worth the trip.


FEMALE STUDENT: Oh definitely.


I'm sorry I had to miss practice, though.


I feel bad about that.


MALE COACH: Family's very important.


FEMALE STUDENT: Yep.


Okay, I guess I'll see you this afternoon at practice, then.


MALE COACH: Just a minute.


There are a couple of other things I need to tell you.


FEMALE STUDENT: Oh, okay.


MALE COACH: Uh ...


First, everybody's getting a new team jacket.


FEMALE STUDENT: Wow. How'd that happen?


MALE COACH: A woman who played here about 20, 25 years ago


came through town a few weeks ago and saw a game,


and said she wanted to do something for the team, so ...


FEMALE STUDENT: So she's buying us new jackets?


MALE COACH: Yep.


FEMALE STUDENT: Wow, that's really nice of her.


MALE COACH: Yes, it is.


It's great that former players still care so much about


our school and our basketball program ...


Anyway you need to fill out an order form.


I'll give it to you now,


so you can bring it back this afternoon.


I've got the forms from the other players,


so as soon as I get yours we can order.


Maybe we'll have the jackets by the next game.


FEMALE STUDENT: OK.


MALE COACH: Great. And the next thing is,


you know Mary's transferring to another college next week,


so we'll need someone to take over her role as captain


for the second half of the season.


And the other players unanimously picked you


to take over as captain when Mary leaves.


FEMALE STUDENT: Wow.


I saw everybody this morning, and nobody said a word.


MALE COACH: They wanted me to tell you.


So, do you accept?


FEMALE STUDENT: Of course!


MICHAEL: So an example of a Gist-content question


for this passage is:


What are the speakers mainly discussing?


And an example of a Gist-purpose question is:


Why does the student go to see the coach?


Whichever question is asked, you can figure out the answer


by focusing on the main point of the conversation or lecture.


The female student tells us her reason


for going to see the coach


in the early part of the conversation when she says this:


FEMALE STUDENT: I just thought I'd stop by to see what I missed


while I was gone.


MICHAEL: That tells us both the main idea of the conversation


and why she went to see the coach.


So for both questions, the best answer is C.


Here's a tip for improving your listening skills.


Listen to academic lectures in English as much as possible.


Be sure to listen to lectures in various subject areas:


science, social science, business, arts, literature.


You can search online for universities


that post their lectures for free.


Start with short lectures on topics you are familiar with,


then build up to longer ones


on topics that are not familiar to you.


Listen to the same lecture multiple times if you need to.


There are lots of ways to improve your English skills.


Whatever you do, keep practicing.


And good luck on your TOEFL test.

[♪MUSIC♪]


Today on Inside the TOEFL Test,


we're going inside the TOEFL iBT Listening section.


Specifically, the Detail questions.


Detail questions are probably the most straightforward


of all the listening question types.


They will ask you to remember specific facts


about the lecture or conversation.


You can recognize detail questions


because they include phrases like "according to"


and "what is" in the question.


Detail questions will always ask


about an important conceptual detail.


You will not be expected to memorize trivial details,


such as whether something happened in 1977 or 1978.


The answer to a Detail question will always be explicitly stated


in the listening conversation or lecture.


Now let's look at a sample Detail question.


First, here's an excerpt from a conversation between a coach


and a student who are catching up on what happened


while the student was away.


FEMALE STUDENT: Okay, I guess I'll see you this afternoon


at practice, then.


MALE COACH: Just a minute.


There are a couple of other things I need to tell you.


FEMALE STUDENT: Oh, okay.


MALE COACH: Uh ...


First, everybody's getting a new team jacket.


FEMALE STUDENT: Wow. How did that happen?


MALE COACH: A woman who played here about 20, 25 years ago


came through town a few weeks ago and saw a game,


and said she wanted to do something for the team, so ...


FEMALE STUDENT: So she's buying us new jackets?


MALE COACH: Yep.


FEMALE STUDENT: Wow, that's really nice of her.


MICHAEL: An example of a detail question is:


Who is buying new jackets for the team?


Again, a detail question will always be a fact


that is directly stated in the listening passage.


The coach explicitly tells the woman that a former player


is the one who is buying the team new jackets,


which makes option C the correct answer.


Here's a tip to help you practice recognizing


important details in a conversation or lecture.


Find a friend or study partner


and listen to a short audio clip.


When it's finished, each of you write down


as much as you can remember.


Then compare notes to see who remembered more of the important


points and supporting details.


There are lots of ways to improve your English skills.


Whatever you do, keep practicing.


And good luck on your TOEFL test.

[♪MUSIC♪]


MICHAEL: Hi, I'm Michael from ETS.


Today on Inside the TOEFL Test,


we're going inside the TOEFL iBT Listening section.


Specifically, the Function questions.


Function questions ask you to identify the particular meaning


of a statement in a given context,


because a statement can have different meanings


depending on the situation.


In other words, the real meaning is different


from the surface or literal meaning.


For example, if you are in a room with other people


and someone says, "It's getting chilly in here,"


what they might really be saying is,


"Could someone close the window?"


You can recognize Function questions


because they include phrases like:


"What does the professor mean when he says...?"


or "Why does the student say ... ?"


Now let's look at a sample question from a conversation


between a coach and a student who are catching up


on what happened while the student was away.


Here is an excerpt from the conversation:


MALE COACH: Hi, Elizabeth.


FEMALE STUDENT: Hey, Coach.


I just thought I'd stop by to see what I missed


while I was gone.


MALE COACH: Well, we've been working real hard on our plan


for the next game ...


I've asked Susan to go over it with you


before practice this afternoon,


so you'll know what we're doing.


FEMALE STUDENT: Okay.


MALE COACH: By the way, how did your brother's wedding go?


FEMALE STUDENT: Oh, it was beautiful.


And the whole family was there.


I saw aunts and uncles and cousins I hadn't seen in years.


MALE COACH: So it was worth the trip.


FEMALE STUDENT: Oh definitely.


I'm sorry I had to miss practice, though.


I feel bad about that.


MALE COACH: Family's very important.


FEMALE STUDENT: Yep.


Okay, I guess I'll see you this afternoon at practice, then.


MICHAEL: Here's an example of a Function question:


What does the man mean when he says "Family's very important"?


When looking at the answer options,


think about the context of the conversation.


So when the coach asks about the wedding, and says things like,


"So it was worth the trip" and "Family is very important,"


you can conclude that the coach understands


and agrees with her decision to miss practice.


So D is the correct answer.


Here's a tip for building your listening skills


that can also help with Function questions:


When listening to a passage,


ask yourself what the speaker is really doing


by saying certain things.


The speaker may be doing things like: Directing; Recommending;


Complaining; Agreeing or Disagreeing; Questioning;


or Confirming.


When you know these types of intentions


and that they often happen "beneath the surface"


of what is said, they can help you identify the function


of what is said more easily.


There are lots of ways to improve your English skills.


Whatever you do, keep practicing.


And good luck on your TOEFL test.

6: Attitude questions

art of transcript. Skip to the end.

[♪MUSIC♪]


MICHAEL: Hi, I'm Michael from ETS.


Today on Inside the TOEFL Test,


we're going inside the TOEFL iBT Listening section.


Specifically, the Attitude questions.


Attitude questions ask you to show understanding


of the speaker's attitude or their feelings about something.


You can recognize Attitude questions


because they include phrases


like "What is the professor's attitude...?" ,


"What does the student think about...?"


and "What can be inferred...?"


To identify the speaker's attitude,


listen for phrases like "What I think..."


or "It seems to me..."


in the lecture or conversation.


The Attitude question will then refer to how valid the speaker's


argument is or how sure of the facts the speaker is.


When you're answering Attitude questions,


listen for the tone of the speaker's voice.


For example,


if a conversation has someone accepting an apology,


their tone would be gentle and understanding.


Now let's look at a sample Attitude question


from a literature lecture about detective novels,


including one titled The Moonstone.


First, listen to the excerpt:


PROFESSOR: Today I'd like to introduce you to a novel that um


some critics consider the finest detective novel ever written.


Um, it was also the first.


We're talking about The Moonstone


by Wilkie Collins.


Now, um, there are other detective stories that preceded


The Moonstone historically-Um, notably uh the work of Poe ...


um, Edgar Allen Poe's stories,


such as "The Murders in the Rue Morgue" and ...


um, "The Purloined Letter."


Now these were short stories that featured a detective ...


uh, probably the first to do that.


But The Moonstone, which follows them by about twenty years-


it was published in 1868- uh,


this is the first full-length detective novel ever written.


Now, in The Moonstone- if you read it as ...


uh, come to it as uh, a contemporary reader-


what's interesting is that most of the features you find


in almost any detective novel are in fact already present.


Umh, it's hard at this juncture to read this novel


and realize that no one had ever done that before,


because it all seems so strikingly familiar.


It's, it's really a wonderful novel and I recommend it,


even just as a fun book to read, if you've never read it.


MICHAEL: Now, here's the Attitude question.


NARRATOR: What attitude does the professor express


when he says this:


PROFESSOR: Uhm, it's hard at this juncture to read this novel


and realize that no one had ever done that before,


because it all seems so strikingly familiar.


MICHAEL: Different attitudes are expressed


in all of the answer choices.


But you can tell that the speaker's attitude


toward the book is positive because he states,


"it's really a wonderful novel and I recommend it."


You can also tell the speaker thinks the book is original


because he mentions multiple times


that the novel is the first of its kind.


For example, when he says,


"this is the first full-length detective novel ever written."


Therefore the correct answer is A.


Here's a listening tip that will help with Attitude questions:


As you practice your listening skills,


you will start noticing each speaker's style


and their tone of voice.


Then ask yourself these questions:


Is the speaker's voice calm or emotional?


Relaxed or nervous?


Certain or confused?


Enthusiastic or bored?


What does the speaker's tone of voice tell you?


Watching comedy television shows is a good way


to practice recognizing a speaker's tone of voice.


There are lots of ways to improve your English skills.


Whatever you do, keep practicing.


And good luck on your TOEFL test.

[♪MUSIC♪]


MICHAEL: Hi, I'm Michael from ETS.


Today on Inside the TOEFL Test,


we're going inside the TOEFL iBT Listening section.


Specifically, the Organization questions.


Organization questions ask you to show understanding


of how a lecture is structured.


You can recognize Organization questions


because they often include phrases


such as "Why does the professor mention...?"


or "Why does the professor discuss...?"


These kinds of phrases show that Organization questions


are often asked about the examples in a lecture,


so it helps to listen for examples,


and think about why the professor is using them.


Now let's look at a sample question.


The question is from a literature lecture about


detective novels, including one titled The Moonstone.


The passage focuses on an important character


from The Moonstone named Sergeant Cuff


who is trying to solve a crime.


Here is an excerpt from the lecture:


PROFESSOR: So, now Cuff arrives.


Uh, Cuff is the man who's coming to solve the mystery,


and-and again he has a lot of the characteristics that


future detectives throughout the history of this genre will have.


Um, He's eccentric.


Um, He has a hobby that he's obsessive about-in this ...


uh, in this case, it's the love of roses.


He's a fanatic about the breeding of roses;


and here think of Nero Wolfe and his orchids,


uh Sherlock Holmes and his violin,


uh a lot of those later classic detective heroes


have this kind of outside interest that they uh ...


they go to as a kind of antidote to the evil


and misery they encounter in their daily lives.


Now, um, these detective heroes .. um..


they have this characteristic of being smart, incredibly smart,


but of not appearing to be smart.


And uh most importantly,


from uh a kind of existential point of view,


these detectives see things that other people do not see.


And that's why the detective is such an important figure,


I think, in our modern imagination.


Um, In the case of The Moonstone-


um I don't want to say too much here and spoil it for you-


but the clue that's key to ...


the solving of the crime is a smeared bit of paint


in a doorway.


Um, of course, the regular police have missed this paint


smear or made some sort of unwarranted assumption about it.


Cuff sees this smear of paint-um this paint,


the place where the paint is smeared-


and realizes that from this one smear of paint


you can actually deduce the whole situation ...


um, the whole world.


And-And that's what the hero in a detective novel like this ...


brings to it that the other characters don't-


it's um it's this ability to see meaning


where others see no meaning


and to bring order ... to where uh it seems there is no order.


MICHAEL: Here's an example of an Organization question:


Why does the professor mention a smeared bit of paint


in a doorway in The Moonstone?


Let's look at the answer choices one at a time.


Choice A can be ruled out


because the professor directly states


that noticing the smeared paint is the key


to solving the crime, not a mistake.


For option B to be correct, there would have been a pattern


of discussing details from the crime scene.


But the smeared paint is the only visual detail


from the crime scene that is mentioned.


So option B is not correct.


Option D can be eliminated because the professor states


that the police officers didn't notice the smeared paint.


Option C is the best answer because the professor talks


about hero detectives in mystery novels


and the characteristics they have in common.


The professor indicates that there is a pattern


when he says this:


PROFESSOR: These detectives see things


that other people do not see.


MICHAEL: Here's a listening tip that can help you understand


how a lecture is organized: Listen for the signal words


that indicate the introduction, major ideas,


examples and the conclusion or summary.


These might be sequence words like "first," "next" and "then."


Or they might indicate time or a chronology,


like "before," "during" or "since."


Or they could show cause and effect,


like "accordingly" or "as a result."


These signal words are good cues for when to take notes.


There are lots of ways to improve your English skills.


Whatever you do, keep practicing.


And good luck on your TOEFL test.

[♪MUSIC♪]


MICHAEL: Hi, I'm Michael from ETS.


Today on Inside the TOEFL Test,


we're going inside the TOEFL iBT Listening section.


Specifically, the Connecting Content questions.


Connecting Content questions ask you to show understanding


of the relationships among ideas in a lecture.


Connecting Content questions may require you


to fill in a chart or table.


Or they may ask things like


"What is the likely outcome...?"


This type of question will ask you to put together information


from different sentences


or different parts of the conversation or lecture.


You may be asked to identify things like:


Steps in a process;


or cause/effect relationships.


Or you may be asked to: Classify items in categories;


or make a prediction.


Now let's look at a sample Connecting Content question.


The question is from a conversation


between a coach and a student


who are catching up on what happened


while the student was away.


Here is an excerpt from the conversation.


MALE COACH: And the next thing is,


you know Mary's transferring to another college next week,


so we'll need someone to take over her role as captain


for the second half of the season.


And the other players unanimously picked you


to take over as captain when Mary leaves.


FEMALE STUDENT: Wow. I saw everybody this morning,


and nobody said a word.


MALE COACH: They wanted me to tell you.


So, do you accept?


FEMALE STUDENT: Of course!


But Susan's a much better player than I am.


I'm really surprised they didn't pick her.


MALE COACH: They think you're the right one.


You'll have to ask them their thoughts.


FEMALE STUDENT: Okay ...


I guess one of the first things I'll have to do as captain


is make sure we get a thank- you card out to the lady


who's buying us the jackets.


MALE COACH: Good idea.


I have her address here somewhere.


FEMALE STUDENT: And I'll make sure the whole team signs it.


MALE COACH: Good. That's all the news there is.


I think that's it for now.


Oh, let me get you that order form.


MICHAEL: Now let's look at the sample question.


Note that for this one, you will choose 2 of the 4 answers.


So why is the woman surprised?


Remember this part of the conversation:


MALE COACH: And the other players unanimously picked you


to take over as captain when Mary leaves.


FEMALE STUDENT: Wow.


I saw everybody this morning, and nobody said a word.


MICHAEL: It's clear that "everyone" refers


to the other team members


and "no one said a word" means that no one on the team


said anything about having picked her


to be their new captain.


So B is one answer.


The second answer is explained when the student says this:


FEMALE STUDENT: But Susan's a much better player than I am.


I'm really surprised they didn't pick her.


MICHAEL: By saying someone else on the team is a better player,


that means that she is not the best player.


So A is the other correct answer.


Here is a tip to help you connect ideas when you listen:


When you listen to recorded material for the first time,


stop the recording at various points,


and try to summarize what has been said.


Then predict what will be said next.


There are lots of ways to improve your English skills.


Whatever you do, keep practicing.


And good luck on your TOEFL test.

MICHAEL: Hi, I'm Michael from ETS.


Today on Inside the TOEFL Test,


we're going inside the TOEFL iBT Listening section.


Specifically, the Inference questions.


Inference questions ask the listener


to show an understanding of the meaning of something


when it is not directly stated in the lecture or conversation.


You can recognize inference questions


because they use phrases like


"What are the implications of ...?,"


"What does the professor imply...?,"


or "What can be inferred...?"


Let's look at a sample inference question from a literature lecture about


detective novels, including a famous one called The Moonstone.


First, here is an excerpt from the lecture:


PROFESSOR: Um, so in The Moonstone, as I said,


uh, Collins did much to establish the conventions


of the detective genre.


Uh, I'm not gonna go into the plot at length,


but, you know, the basic setup is ...


um, there's this diamond of great uh ..


of great value, uh, a country house,


uh, the diamond mysteriously disappears


in the middle of the night,


um, the local police are brought in,


in an attempt to solve the crime,


and they mess it up completely, uh,


and then the true hero of the book arrives.


That's Sergeant Cuff.


Now, Cuff, this extraordinarily important character um ...


well, let me try to give you a sense of who Sergeant Cuff is,


by first describing the regular police.


And uh this is the dynamic that you're going to see


throughout the history of the detective novel,


um, where you have the regular cops-who are well-meaning,


but officious and bumblingly inept-and uh they are countered


by a figure who's eccentric, analytical, brilliant, and ...


and able to solve the crime.


So, uh first the regular police get called in


to solve the mystery-


Um, in this case, detective, uh, Superintendent Seegrave.


When Superintendent Seegrave comes in,


uh he orders his minions around, uh they bumble,


and they actually make a mess of the investigation,


uh which you'll see repeated-


um, you'll see this pattern repeated,


particularly in the Sherlock Holmes stories


of a few years later where, uh, Inspector Lestrade,


this well-meaning idiot, is always countered, uh,


by Sherlock Holmes, who's a genius.


MICHAEL: Now, let's look at the question.


NARRATOR: What does the professor imply


when he says this:


PROFESSOR: Well, let me try to give you a sense of


who Sergeant Cuff is, by first describing the regular police.


MICHAEL: We can see that this is an inference question


because it uses the word "imply" and asks the listener


to understand the meaning of something


that is not directly stated by the professor.


When the professor says this:


PROFESSOR: Well, let me try to give you a sense of


who Sergeant Cuff is, by first describing the regular police.


MICHAEL: He is hinting that there is a difference


between the behavior of the regular police


and that of Sergeant Cuff.


This contrast is supported in other parts of the passage.


For example, the speaker describes the regular police


as "bumblingly inept."


He also says it is common in detective novels for them


to be countered by a specific character,


in this case Sergeant Cuff, who is "brilliant."


Taken together, we can see that the best answer is A,


Sergeant Cuff is unlike the regular police in The Moonstone.


Here's a tip for improving your listening skills:


Listen to recordings of two speakers


with different viewpoints


about the same topic.


What words do the speakers use to support their ideas?


Are the words mainly positive or negative?


Then look at how they imply positive or negative ideas


without saying them directly.


There are lots of ways to improve your English skills.


Whatever you do, keep practicing.


And good luck on your TOEFL test.

10: Scoring listening, reading questions

Start of transcript. Skip to the end.

(♪Music♪)


- Let's talk about how ETS determines scores


for the Reading and Listening sections of the test.


Most of the questions in the Reading and Listening sections


are standard multiple choice questions


with one correct answer and are worth one point.


Some questions in these sections have two


correct answers, but these question are also


worth one point.


A small number of questions in the Reading


and Listening sections can be worth more


than one point.


The number of possible points you can get


will be stated in the directions for these questions.


The good news is, if a question is worth


two or more points, it means you can get some credit


for answering part of the question correctly.


The number of questions you answer correctly


in each of these sections is what we call a raw score.


Statisticians then conduct analyses to convert


the raw score into a scaled score, between zero and 30.


Why is that important?


Scaled scores allow for comparisons of forms


of the test given on different dates


with different questions.


That means that your Reading and Listening scores


will accurately reflect your reading and listening ability


regardless of which test form you get on test day.

Listening Practice Test: Part 1
Narrator
Listen to a conversation between a student and his faculty advisor.
Professor
Hi, Steve. I scheduled this appointment ’cause it’s been a while since we touched base.
Student
I know. I’ve been really busy. A friend of mine works on the school paper. He asked me if I’d like to try reporting. So I did, and I really love it.
Professor
Hey, that sounds great.
Student
Yeah, the first article I wrote, it was a profile of the chemistry professor, the one who was named teacher of the year. My article ran on the front page. When I saw my name, I mean, my byline, in print, I was hooked. Now I know this is what I want to do—be a reporter.
Professor
Isn’t it great to discover something that you really enjoy? And I read that article, too. It was very good.
Student
To be honest, the article got lots of editing. In fact, I barely recognized a couple of paragraphs. But the editor explained why the changes were made. I learned a lot, and my second article didn’t need nearly as many changes.
Professor
Sounds like you’ve got a real knack for this.
Student
Yeah. Anyway, I’m glad you scheduled this meeting ’cause I wanna change my major to journalism now.
Professor
Um. The university doesn’t offer a major in journalism.
Student
Oh no!
Professor
But—
Student
I-I mean … should I transfer to another school? Or major in English?
Professor
Well, wait a minute. Let me explain why the major isn’t offered. Editors at newspapers … editors … I mean, when you apply for a reporting job, editors look at two things: they wanna see clips, you know, some of your published articles. They’ll also want you to try out. They’ll give you an assignment, like, um, covering a press conference or some other event, then see if you can craft a story about it, accurately, on deadline.
Student
So they don’t even look at my major?
Professor
It’s not that they don’t look at it … it’s … well, having a degree in something other than journalism should actually work to your advantage.
Student How?
Professor
Most journalists specialize these days. They only write about science, or business, or technology, for example. Is there a type of reporting you think you might like to specialize in?
Student
Well, I think it’d be really cool to cover the Supreme Court. I mean, their decisions affect so many people.
Professor
That’s really a goal worth striving for. So, why not continue majoring in political science? And, as electives, you could take some pre-law classes, like constitutional law. And as for your work on the student newspaper, maybe they’d let you cover some local court cases, ones that students and professors here would wanna read about.
Student
Do you know of any?
Professor
Well, I do, actually. There’s a case involving this computer software program that one of our professors wrote. The district court’s deciding if the university’s entitled to any of the professor’s profits.
Student
Wow. I’ll definitely follow up on that.

Listening Practice Test: Part 2

Listening Practice Test: Part 2
Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a psychology class.
Professor
We’ve said that the term “cognition” refers to mental states like knowing and believing, and to mental processes that we use to arrive at those states. So, for example, reasoning is a cognitive process. So is perception—we use information that we perceive through our senses to help us make decisions, to arrive at beliefs and so on. And then there are memory and imagination, which relate to the knowledge of things that happened in the past or may happen in the future. So, perceiving, remembering, imagining are all internal mental processes that lead to knowing or believing.

Yet each of these processes has limitations, and can lead us to hold mistaken beliefs or make false predictions.

Take memory, for example. Maybe you’ve heard of studies in which people hear a list of related words—um, let’s say a list of different kinds of fruit. After hearing this list, they’re presented with several additional words. In this case, we’ll say the additional words were “blanket” and “cherry.” Neither of these words was on the original list. And while people will claim correctly that “blanket” was not on the original list, they’ll also claim, incorrectly, that the word “cherry” was on the list.

Most people are convinced they heard the word “cherry” on the original list. Why do they make such a simple mistake? Well, we think because the words on the list were so closely related, the brain stored only the gist of what it heard, for example, that all the items on the list were types of fruit. When we tap our memory, our brains often fill in details, and quite often these details are actually false.

We also see this “fill-in” phenomenon with perception.

Perception is the faculty that allows us to process information in the present, as we take it in via our senses. Again, studies have shown that people will “fill in” information that they thought they perceived, even when they didn’t. For example, experiments have been done where a person hears a sentence, but it’s missing the word that logically completes it. They’ll claim to hear that word even though it was never said. So if I were to say, “The Sun rises in the…” and then fail to complete the sentence, people will often claim to have heard the word “east.”

In cognitive psychology we have a phrase for this kind of inaccurate “filling in” of details. It’s called a “blind spot.” The term originally referred to the place in our eyes
where the optic nerve connects the back of the eye to the brain. There are no photoreceptors in the area where the nerve connects to the eye, so that particular area of the eye is incapable of detecting images—it produces a blind spot in our field of vision. We aren’t aware of it because the brain fills in what it thinks belongs in the image, so the picture always appears complete to us.

But the term “blind spot” has also taken on a more general meaning—it refers to people being unaware of a bias that may affect their judgment about a subject.

And the same blind spot phenomenon that affects memory and perception also affects imagination. Imagination is a faculty that some people use to anticipate future events in their lives. But the ease with which we imagine details can lead to unrealistic expectations and can bias our decisions.

So, um, Peter, suppose I ask you to imagine a lunch salad. No problem, right? But I bet you imagined specific ingredients. Did yours have tomatoes? Onion? Lettuce? Mine did. Our brains fill in all sorts of details that might not be part of other people’s image of a salad. Which could lead to disappointment for us—if the next time we order a salad in a restaurant we have our imagined salad in mind, that’s not necessarily what we’ll get on our plate. The problem’s not that we imagine things, but that we assume what we’ve imagined is accurate. We should be aware that our imagination has this built-in feature—the blind spot—which makes our predictions fall short of reality.

[Listening Practice Test Part 3](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:ETSx+TOEFLx+3T2020/block-v1:ETSx+TOEFLx+3T2020+type@sequential+block@3a6181a8ce1e4999a2304e662d4cad19/block-v1:ETSx+TOEFLx+3T2020+type@vertical+block@7c71df93ff924644a421b8f4e8bdda49)


Listening Practice Test: Part 3

Listening Practice Test: Part 3

Narrator
Listen to part of a lecture in a biology class.
Professor
Almost all animals have some way of regulating their body temperature; otherwise, they wouldn’t survive extreme hot or cold conditions. Sweating, panting, swimming to cooler or warmer water, ducking into somewhere cool like a burrow or a hole under a rock … these are just a few. And that spot is colder or warmer than the surrounding environment because it’s a microclimate.

A microclimate is a group of climate conditions that affect a localized area—weather features like temperature, wind, moisture, and so on … And when I say localized, I mean really localized, because microclimates can be, as the name suggests, pretty small, even less than a square meter. And microclimates are affected by a huge number of other variables … obviously weather conditions in the surrounding area are a factor. But other aspects of the location, like, uh, the elevation of the land, uh, the plant life nearby, and so on, have a substantial effect on microclimates. And, of course, the human development in the area … um, a road’ll affect a nearby microclimate. It’s also interesting to note that microclimates that are near each other can have very different conditions … in the forest, for example, there can be a number of very different microclimates close to each other because of all the variables I just mentioned.

Student
So how does a hole in the ground, a burrow, stay cool in a hot climate?

Professor
Well, since cold air sinks, and these spots are shaded, they’re usually much cooler than the surrounding area. And these spots are so important because many animals rely on microclimates to regulate their body temperature. Um … for instance, there is a species of squirrel in the western part of the United States that can get really hot when they’re out foraging for food, so they need a way to cool down. So what do they do? They go back to their own burrow. Once they get there, their body temperatures decrease very, very quickly. The trip to the burrow prevents the squirrel from getting too hot.

Student
But squirrels are mammals, right? I thought mammals regulated their temperature internally …

Professor
Mammals do have the ability to regulate their body temperature … but not all can do it to the same degree. Or even the same way. Like when you walk outside on a hot day you perspire and your body cools itself down--a classic example of how a mammal regulates its own body temperature. But one challenge that squirrels face, well, many small mammals do, is that because of their size, sweating would make them lose too much moisture. They’d dehydrate. But on the other hand, their small size allows them to fit into very tiny spaces. So for small mammals, microclimates can make a big difference—they rely on microclimates for survival.

Student
So cold-blooded animals, like reptiles—they can’t control their own body temperature, so I can imagine the effect a microclimate would have on them …

Professor
Yes. Many reptiles and insects rely on microclimates to control their body temperature. A lot of reptiles use burrows … or stay under rocks to cool down. Of course, with reptiles, it’s a balancing act. Staying in the heat for too long can lead to problems, but staying in the cold can do the same. So reptiles hafta be really precise about where they spend their time, even how they position their bodies. And when I say they’re precise I mean it—some snakes will search out a place under rocks of a specific thickness, because too thin a rock doesn’t keep them cool enough and too thick a rock will cause them to get too cold. That level of precision is critical to the snake for maintaining its body temperature.

And even microscopic organisms rely on microclimates for survival. Think about this: decomposing leaves create heat that warms the soil; the warm soil in turn affects the growth, the conditions of organisms there, and those organisms then affect the rate of decomposition of the leaves … So a microclimate can be something so small and so easily disturbed that even a tiny change can have a big impact. If someone on a hike knocks a couple of rocks over, they could be unwittingly destroying a microclimate that an animal or organism relies on.

- This week, we went inside the listening section of
the TOEFL test.
We started the week by discussing how to approach listening
to a conversation or a lecture.
There were four key takeaways from that lesson.
First, listen for the main idea or purpose of the passage.
You can use the introductory line and initial photo,
or words on the screen, to help you get oriented.
Second, listen for the key supporting points.
Third, as you listen, notice the speaker's attitudes
and opinions.
And finally, keep listening.
Don't worry if you miss a fact, or a detail.
Just continue to listen.
Later in the week, we took a look at the different
question types that are in this section of the TOEFL test,
including Organization and Connecting Content questions.
We also practiced what we learned by studying real past
TOEFL test questions.
Next week, we're going inside the speaking section of
the TOEFL test with Molly, where we will learn about
the speaking question types, and we will share tips
to help you do your best on test day.
Be sure to ask us any general questions you have about
the speaking section in the discussion board, such as
how will my speaking score be affected by my pronunciation.
Next week, be ready to participate.
