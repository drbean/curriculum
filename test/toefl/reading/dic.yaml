...ng to talk about how to approach
the TOEFL iBT Reading passage.
Good reading techniques will give you the best chance
to do well on the TOEFL reading section.
It's a good idea to begin by focusing on the big picture.
What topic is going to be discussed in the passage?
Before you begin to read,
take a look at the title,
and the illustration at the beginning of the passage.
If there is one.
Then, for the text, you can use the technique
called skimming.
Take a glance at the first few sentences
of the first paragraph.
These sentences form the introduction
and usually give the reader an idea of
what is to come.
Then take a look at the first sentence
of each of the other paragraphs.
These sentences often provide information
about the main point, or points,
in each paragraph.
At this stage, you should have an impression
of what the main topic of the passage is.
As well as an understanding of some of
the key ideas to be discussed.
You should also have an impression
about the author's intent.
Is the author explaining a phenomenon,
or presenting opposing points of view?
What is the main purpose of the text you're reading?
While you skim, pay attention
to the structure, or organization of the passage.
You may want to take notes
in the form of an outline.
Here's an example.
Now you're ready to carefully read the passage
from beginning to end.
As you read, you can fill in more of the outline.
Such as the specific details
that support some of the key ideas.
Remember to just jot down phrases.
The outline, or notes, are only meant
to help you remember what you've read.
You shouldn't spend a lot of time writing.
Don't worry if you don't understand
everything in the passage.
It's not necessary to understand every detail.
What is important is that you understand
the main idea being discussed.
It's also important to think about
why the author has included pieces of information.
Is a piece of information an example
of a phenomenon?
A supporting detail for an argument?
Or, perhaps the introduction of a new idea.
After reading through the passage,
begin to look at the questions.
Once you read each question,
you can go back to the passage
to look in a targeted way
for the information you need to answer that question.
This is called scanning.
For instance, if a question asks about climate
in the Middle Ages, then look for those words in the passage.
After you've located them,
re-read the phrases and sentences
containing those words.
You should be able to find the information you need
to answer the question.
Remember, that as you look at each question
you'll be able to see the paragraph,
or paragraphs, that the question refers to
on one side of your computer screen.
You will also be able to scroll through
the entire passage.
So, if you keep these things in mind,
you should be able to move through
all the questions for each reading passage
at a reasonable pace.
Just remember to answer all the questions
the best you can.

[♪Music♪]
- If you're like me, you like to read popular
magazines for fun.
Maybe sports magazines,
or magazines about celebrities.
These kinds of magazines can be helpful
when you're learning English.
As part of a broad strategy for building
your reading skills with an array
of English language texts.
They're full of engaging topics
and interesting opinions expressed
in an informal tone.
But to be successful on the TOEFL test,
you need to read academic texts
as part of your preparation strategy.
At any university, you will encounter textbooks
and articles on a wide variety
of academic subjects.
Including the social sciences,
the arts, and
physical and life sciences.
Because these are the kinds of texts you'll
be using in university courses.
They're also the kinds of texts you'll see
on the TOEFL test.
So, today we're going to look at
three key characteristics of academic texts.
First, academic texts generally use
formal language.
Stylistically, there are probably very few contractions
or abbreviations.
In terms of vocabulary, the author may use
specialized, or infrequently used words.
And almost no idioms or slang expressions.
Also, the author may use grammar that is
not typical of everyday spoken language.
Or, text written for non-academic purposes.
r, text written for non-academic purposes.
Such as entertainment.
Next, the material is presented in a logical
and objective way, that is to say,
without personal bias.
Based on facts, not feelings.
Whereas popular writing often exaggerates
and appeals to emotions.
Due to its objectivity, the tone may feel
impersonal, rather than personal.
A popular magazine article, on the other hand,
may be written in a way that tries
to appeal to your emotions.
Maybe it tries to get you to care about
whether a contract between a sports team
and a particular player will be renewed, for example.
Or, maybe it tries to make you upset
that a certain celebrity wasn't chosen for a role
in an upcoming movie.
Textbooks and academic papers generally
won't try to appeal to your emotions.
Last, academic texts are conceptually complex.
This means the ideas being presented
in an academic text may not be straightforward ones.
In other words, they may be nuanced,
or multidimensional.
Not simplistic.
And the relationship among those ideas
may also be complicated.
There may be interconnected parts.
These parts may be spread across the text.
So the reader may need to draw connections
between individual sentences
or across paragraphs.
Additionally, the reader may need to draw
inferences, which means, the reader has to
read between the lines.
This doesn't necessarily mean academic
texts are difficult, it just means that they
are not simplistic in their presentation of material.
So, to review.
Academic texts use formal language.
They present ideas logically and objectively.
And they are conceptually complex.
When you practice reading in English,
be sure you are reading quality academic texts.
They will help you prepare for test day
and beyond.

   MICHAEL: Hi, I'm Michael from ETS.


Today on Inside the TOEFL Test,
we're going inside the TOEFL iBT Reading section.
Specifically, the Factual Information
and Negative Factual Information questions.
Factual Information questions ask you to recognize information
that is explicitly stated in the text.
These may include facts such as major ideas, supporting details,
or definitions.
Negative factual information questions are similar,
except that, instead of only one answer being true,
three of the four answers are true,
and you have to determine which one is false.
Factual Information questions will have phrases like
"According to the paragraph,"
or "Paragraph X answers which of the following?"
in the question.
For Negative Factual Information questions,
look for the words "NOT" or "EXCEPT" in capital letters.
Here are some tips for answering Factual
and Negative Factual Information questions:
Number 1. Don't automatically select an answer
just because it contains words or phrases from the paragraph.
Make sure you carefully evaluate each option
to determine if it is correct.
2. For the Negative Factual Information questions,
remember that you're looking for an answer
that either isn't in the paragraph,
or directly contradicts information in the paragraph.
Let's look at a sample Factual Information question.
First, here's an excerpt from a reading passage
about meteorite impacts.
And here's the question.
Be careful when selecting your answer,
because 3 of the 4 answer choices misstate information
from the passage OR contradict information from the passage.
One answer we can definitely eliminate is C,
because there is no mention in this paragraph
of archeologists working in the Yucatan region.
Choice A looks like what is said here in the last two sentences,
where it does say they found the crater in 1990.
But they determined in 1980 that there was a meteorite impact,
so it's not choice A.
Choice D is incorrect
because it says that "they located a meteorite,"
which is not true because what they found was the crater,
and other evidence of the meteorite impact,
not the meteorite itself.
That leaves choice B, which is supported
by the second and third sentences.
The second sentence mentions
"the worldwide layer of sediment"
and the third sentence explains how it is unique.
Therefore B is the correct answer.
Now let's look at a Negative Factual Information question.
Here is another paragraph about meteorite impacts
from the same reading passage.
And here's the question.
You know it's a Negative Factual Information question
because of the word EXCEPT in capital letters.
So three of the choices are going to match information
in the paragraph, and only one will not.
Let's see how many correct choices we can find by scanning
for key words that appear in the answers, like dust, sunlight,
cold, dark, elements, crust, and nitric acid.
We may also need to look for synonyms of these words.
So if we scan the paragraph for some text about dust
and blocked sunlight that corresponds to choice A,
we find this, and it's a match.
Choice B is here, where it talks about the cold and darkness.
There is nothing in the paragraph
that talks about new elements or the Earth's crust,
so choice C looks like it might be the answer.
For choice D, we found that information here,
where it talks about nitric acid.
So choice C is our answer.
Here is a tip to help you improve your reading skills.
Read news and magazine articles about various subjects
as often as you can, and practice taking notes.
When deciding what to write down,
ask yourself what pieces of information are important,
or relevant or credible.
Then write those down, but keep the notes short.
That will help you remember important information
in what you read.
There are lots of ways to improve your English skills.
Whatever you do, keep practicing.
And good luck on your TOEFL test.

MICHAEL: Hi, I'm Michael from ETS.
Today on Inside the TOEFL Test,
we're going inside the TOEFL iBT Reading section.
Specifically, the Inference and Rhetorical Purpose questions.
Inference questions ask you to identify information
or comprehend an idea that is not explicitly stated
in the reading passage.
You can recognize Inference questions because they usually
include the words "infer," "imply" or "suggest,"
like in these examples.
Rhetorical Purpose questions are similar,
because they also ask
for information not explicitly stated.
These will ask why the author has presented
a piece of information.
One way to approach these types of questions,
if you can't identify the correct answer immediately,
is to eliminate wrong answers.
You will see more on this as we go through the example.
Now let's do a sample Inference question.
Here's a paragraph from a reading passage
about meteorite impacts.
Next, let's look at the question.
You see that it uses the word "inferred,"
so that clearly tells you that it's an inference question
Can you identify the correct answer?
It's Choice C, because it's supported by this sentence,
which indicates that scientists knew in 1980
that there had been an impact...
...and this one, where it says the site had been located
in the Yucatan.
Let's look at why the other choices can be eliminated.
Choice A is not correct,
because there isn't anything written
or implied in the passage
about geologists keeping the impact site secret.
Choice B is also not correct.
Saying that it was a "well known fact"
contradicts the passage where it talks about the discovery
of the crater in the Yucatan.
Choice D also can't be correct,
because the paragraph doesn't mention climate as a factor
in the discovery of the impact site.
Now let's look at an example of a rhetorical purpose question.
It asks about information from a different paragraph
in the same reading passage about meteorites and dinosaurs.
It's like an Inference question, but it asks WHY the author
includes a particular piece of information.
When reading each answer choice, the most important part to focus
on is the "to clause" at the beginning of each one.
Then pick the answer that best describes
what the author is trying to do.
In this case, the correct answer is C.
One way to build your reading skills
is by practicing skimming,
which is reading quickly to identify major points.
One way to skim is to read the introductory paragraph,
then the first sentence of each of the middle paragraphs,
and then read the concluding paragraph.
When you're practicing, try reading a passage twice,
the first time skimming to get the main ideas,
then read it again more carefully to see
if you really DID get those main ideas.
Another tip that will help with Rhetorical purpose questions
is to make sure you know the definition of these words,
because they are often used to describe
kinds of rhetorical purposes.
There are lots of ways to improve your English skills.
Whatever you do, keep practicing.
And good luck on your TOEFL test.

Michael: Hi, I'm Michael from ETS. Today on Inside the TOEFL Test we're going inside the TOEFL iBT Reading section. Specifically, the Vocabulary questions.  

On-screen: 
Inside the TOEFL® Test – Reading
 Vocabulary

 Michael: Vocabulary questions ask you to identify the meanings of words and phrases as they are used in the reading passage.

 It's easy to identify Vocabulary questions, because there will be a word or phrase highlighted in the reading passage, and you will see questions like these, with phrases like "closest in meaning" or "the author means." 

 On-screen: 
  Vocabulary- identify meanings of words and phrases
   Word or phrase highlighted in the reading passage
   •The word "X" in the passage is closest in meaning to…
   •The phrase "X" in the passage is closest in meaning to…
   •In stating "X", the author means that…

 Michael: Now let's look at a sample vocabulary question. This one is from a reading passage about meteorite impacts.
  Here's an excerpt from the passage with the vocabulary word highlighted.  
   Here's the sample question, which asks the meaning of the word "pose".

   Now, there's really not much strategy in answering these vocabulary questions. .

 On-screen: 
  There is increasing evidence that the impacts of meteorites have had important effects on Earth, particularly in the field of biological evolution. Such impacts continue to pose a natural hazard to life on Earth.

  The word "pose" is closest in meaning to
  a.claim
  b.model
  c.assume
  d.present

  Green check appears next to answer option D. present

 Michael: The words that are tested are academic vocabulary that you should know if your English is at the level of a university student.

 They are not usually words that you can guess from context. So the best general strategy to be ready for this type of questions is to build your vocabulary. 

 On-screen: Academic Vocabulary – words that students at university level should know

 Michael: Keep in mind that there's a difference between academic vocabulary and specialized vocabulary. Academic vocabulary words can be used across many fields of study. These are the kind of words you'll be tested on.

 Specialized vocabulary words are specific to one field. If words like this are in a TOEFL reading passage, they will be defined for you. 

 On-screen: Academic Vocabulary (Expected to know)
 •Arbitrary
 •Capacity
 •Fluctuate
 •Relatively

 Specialized Vocabulary (Defined for you)
 •Cadence (Music)
 •Monopolies (Business)
 •Desertification (Earth Science)
 •Cetaceans (Biology)

  
 Michael: Here is a tip for increasing your vocabulary:
    Many English words come from Latin or Greek.  So if you study Latin and Greek roots that will help you remember the meanings of words.  And it can also help you figure out the meanings of words you may not know.

 On-screen: 
  Latin and Greek roots of English words

  Root word  Origin Meaning Examples and Definitions 
  bio Greek life Biology- science of life 
  cardi Greek heart Cardiac - relating to the heart 
  retro Latin back Retrospect - review past events 
  vac Latin empty Vacant – not occupied 

   

 Michael: For example, if you know that the Latin root "terra" means earth, then when you see this sentence from the passage that talks about the "terrestrial material" found at the impact site, you'll know that it's referring to the material from the earth, not from the meteorite.

 On-screen: terra = earth

 Even diluted by the terrestrial material excavated from the crater, this component of meteorites is easily identified.

 Michael: There are lots of ways to improve your English skills. Whatever you do, keep practicing. And good luck on your TOEFL test.

Sentence simplification questions

Michael: Hi, I'm Michael from ETS. Today on Inside the TOEFL Test, we're going inside the TOEFL iBT Reading section. Specifically, the Sentence Simplification questions.  

On-screen: 
Inside the TOEFL® Test – Reading
 Sentence Simplification

 Michael: Sentence Simplification questions ask you to identify a sentence that has essentially the same meaning as a sentence from the reading passage. The correct answer choice contains the main ideas from the sentence in the passage but may leave out minor or unimportant details. It should restate the most important information in a simpler way.

 On-screen: 
  Sentence Simplification – Identify a sentence that has essentially the same meaning
  •Correct answer contains the main ideas restated in a simpler way

 Michael: Sentence Simplification questions are easy to recognize because the wording of the question is always exactly the same: 
  "Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the following sentence? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information."

 On-screen: Sentence Simplification
  Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the following sentence? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.

 Michael: The highlighted sentence will have both essential and non-essential information. Your job is to pick the answer choice that best includes the essential information and leaves out the non-essential information.
  Answering this type of question will require you to understand the relationship between the pieces of information in the sentence.
   Often, there is an important cause/effect relationship, or there may be a conclusion based on some evidence. So look for those same ideas in the answer choices.

 On-screen: Essential information (green check appears)
  Non-essential information (red x appears)

  Relationship between pieces of information in the sentence
  •Cause/effect
  •Conclusion based on evidence

 Michael: Here's an example of a sentence simplification question from a passage about meteorite impacts and dinosaur extinction.
  This type of question can be challenging, because all of the answer choices will contain words or phrases that are similar to ones in the given sentence. 
   For example, 3 of the answer choices talk about the explosion… 
    … 3 talk about fires
    … and 3 mention the destruction of plant life

     

 On-screen: Which of the sentences below best expresses the essential information in the following sentence? Incorrect choices change the meaning in important ways or leave out essential information.

 The explosion is also calculated to have produced vast quantities of nitric acid and melted rock that sprayed out over much of Earth, starting widespread fires that must have consumed most terrestrial forests and grassland. 
 a.Scientists believe that large amounts of nitric acid and melted rock were released by the explosion, causing fires that probably destroyed most of Earth's plant-life
 b.Fires spread out over Earth, burning many forests and releasing nitric acid and other materials into the atmosphere.
 c.Scientists have calculated the amount of nitric acid and melted rock that was released on Earth after the explosion.
 d.Scientists believe that large fires in forests must have spread to grasslands and caused explosions that destroyed most of Earth's plants.

 Michael: So, can you identify the correct answer? It's A, because all of the important information is aligned with the given sentence.
  Both the given sentence and choice A talk about the large amounts of nitric acid and melted rock…
   …that were the result of the explosion…
    …and that started fires that destroyed plant life.

 On-screen: 
 The explosion is also calculated to have produced vast quantities of nitric acid and melted rock that sprayed out over much of Earth, starting widespread fires that must have consumed most terrestrial forests and grassland.

 Green check appears next to answer choice A. Scientists believe that large amounts of nitric acid and melted rock were released by the explosion, causing fires that probably destroyed most of Earth's plant-life

 Michael: The other responses have content that contradicts the highlighted sentence, or just isn't there. 
  Choice B looks like a good answer at first, because it talks about the fires spreading and burning forests… 

  But choice B says that it was the fires that released the nitric acid, which is different from the highlighted sentence, which says that the nitric acid, along with the melted rock, caused the fires.

 On-screen: 
  The explosion is also calculated to have produced vast quantities of nitric acid and melted rock that sprayed out over much of Earth, starting widespread fires that must have consumed most terrestrial forests and grassland.

  Red X appears next to answer choice B. Fires spread out over Earth, burning many forests and releasing nitric acid and other materials into the atmosphere.

 Michael: Choice C can be eliminated because it leaves out essential information about the fires and the destruction of forests and plant life.

 On-screen: 
  Red X appears next to answer choice C. Scientists have calculated the amount of nitric acid and melted rock that was released on Earth after the explosion.

 Michael: Finally, choice D is incorrect because again, the cause and effect are reversed. This one says that the fires caused the explosions, when it was really the other way around.

 On-screen: 
  Red X appears next to answer choice D. Scientists believe that large fires in forests must have spread to grasslands and caused explosions that destroyed most of Earth's plants.

 Michael: One tip to build your reading skills, which will also help you answer sentence simplification questions, is to look at complex sentences or paragraphs, and separate the main ideas from less important information.
  Non-essential information can be things like examples, or text in parentheses, or very specific information like numbers or dates.

 On-screen: Identify Main Ideas
  Main ideas

 Less important information:
   •Examples
   •Parentheses
   •Numbers/dates

    
 Michael: There are lots of ways to improve your English skills. Whatever you do, keep practicing. And good luck on your TOEFL test.

 Insert Text

 Michael: The Insert Text questions are designed to show that you understand the logical order of ideas in a reading passage. 

 On-screen: Insert Text- understand the logical order of ideas in a reading passage

 Michael: In the reading section, every reading passage has one Insert Text question. But instead of choosing from a list of 4 choices, like with most Reading questions, you will click on one of the 4 black squares to insert the text into the paragraph.

 On-screen: 
  Insert Text- one for each reading passage

  Look at the four squares [■] that indicate where the following sentence can be added to the passage.

  Some companies in the power industry are aware of this wider possibility and are planning sizable wind-farm projects in states other than California.

  Where would the sentence best fit?

  Since 1980, the use of wind to produce electricity has been growing rapidly. Some companies in the power industry are aware of this wider possibility and are planning sizable wind-farm projects in states other than California. In 1994 there were nearly 20,000 wind turbines worldwide, most grouped in clusters called wind farms that collectively produced 3,000 megawatts of electricity. ■ Most were in Denmark (which got 3 percent of its electricity from wind turbines) and California (where 17,000 machines produced 1 percent of the state's electricity, enough to meet the residential needs of a city as large as San Fransico). ■ In principle, all the power needs of the United States could be provided by exploiting the wind potential of just three states – North Dakota, South Dakota, and Texas. ■
   Large wind farms can be built in six months to a year and then easily expanded as needed. With a moderate to fairly high net energy yield, these systems emit no heat-trapping carbon dioxide or other air pollutants and need no water for cooling; manufacturing them produces little water pollution. The land under wind turbines can be used for grazing cattle and other purposes, and leasing land for wind turbines can provide extra income for farmers and rachers.

   Click a square to insert text
    Change location as needed

     

 Michael: During the real test, you can change the location of the sentence as many times as you need to, so you can see how it works in each of the four places.

 On-screen: Since 1980, the use of wind to produce electricity has been growing rapidly. ■ In 1994 there were nearly 20,000 wind turbines worldwide, most grouped in clusters called wind farms that collectively produced 3,000 megawatts of electricity.

The land under wind turbines can be used for grazing cattle and other purposes, and leasing land for wind turbines can provide extra income for farmers and rachers.

 On-screen: Sample question

 Michael: Here's a sample Insert Text question, and the corresponding paragraph.
  Note that the sentence says "This is the criterion…" And it's important to look for pronouns. The pronoun here is "this," so there is probably something about a criterion in the previous sentence. 
   If we insert the sentence at square number 4, the previous sentence talks about "the standard criterion," and the following sentence says "Yet an equally important criterion". So that's a likely choice. And when you read those sentences together, the sentences do flow logically. So this is the correct answer.

 On-screen: Look at the four squares [■] that indicate where the following sentence can be added to the passage.

 This is the criterion emphasized by Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.

 Where would the sentence best fit?

 Impacts by meteorites represent one mechanism that could cause global catastrophes and seriously influence the evolution of life all over the planet. ■ According to some estimates, the majority of all extinctions of species may be due to such impacts. ■ Such a perspective fundamentally changes our view of biological evolution. ■ The standard criterion for survival of a species is its success in competing with other species and adapting to slowly changing environments. This is the criterion emphasized by Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. Yet an equally important criterion is the ability of a species to survive random global ecological catastrophes due to impacts.

 Michael: One tip for improving your reading is to really know your pronouns, and to practice matching them to the words they refer to in a text. Here are a few of the most common pronouns that you will see when you read.

 On-screen: Skill Building Tip – know your pronouns
 •This/these
 •That/those
 •They/them

       Sample Questions  - Prose Summary

   Michael: Let's look at a sample Prose Summary question. This type of question covers the whole reading passage, not just a single sentence or paragraph. Here's the passage about meteorites and dinosaur extinction.

   On-screen: Meteorite Impact and Dinosaur Extinction 

   There is increasing evidence that the impacts of meteorites have had important effects on Earth, particularly in the field of biological evolution. Such impacts continue to pose a natural hazard to life on Earth. Twice in the twentieth century, large meteorite objects are known to have collided with Earth. 

   If an impact is large enough, it can disturb the environment of the entire Earth and cause an ecological catastrophe. The best-documented such impact took place 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period of geological history. This break in Earth's history is marked by a mass extinction, when as many as half the species on the planet became extinct. While there are a dozen or more mass extinctions in the geological record, the Cretaceous mass extinction has always intrigued paleontologists because it marks the end of the age of the dinosaurs. For tens of millions of years, those great creatures had flourished. Then, suddenly, they disappeared. 

   The body that impacted Earth at the end of the Cretaceous period was a meteorite with a mass of more than a trillion tons and a diameter of at least 10 kilometers. Scientists first identified this impact in 1980 from the worldwide layer of sediment deposited from the dust cloud that enveloped the planet after the impact. This sediment layer is enriched in the rare metal iridium and other elements that are relatively abundant in a meteorite but very rare in the crust of Earth. Even diluted by the terrestrial material excavated from the crater, this component of meteorites is easily identified. By 1990 geologists had located the impact site itself in the Yucatán region of Mexico. The crater, now deeply buried in sediment, was originally about 200 kilometers in diameter. 

   This impact released an enormous amount of energy, excavating a crater about twice as large as the lunar crater Tycho. The explosion lifted about 100 trillion tons of dust into the atmosphere, as can be determined by measuring the thickness of the sediment layer formed when this dust settled to the surface. Such a quantity of material would have blocked the sunlight completely from reaching the surface, plunging Earth into a period of cold and darkness that lasted at least several months. The explosion is also calculated to have produced vast quantities of nitric acid and melted rock that sprayed out over much of Earth, starting widespread fires that must have consumed most terrestrial forests and grassland. Presumably, those environmental disasters could have been responsible for the mass extinction, including the death of the dinosaurs. Several other mass extinctions in the geological record have been tentatively identified with large impacts, but none is so dramatic as the Cretaceous event. But even without such specific documentation, it is clear that impacts of this size do occur and that their results can be catastrophic. What is a catastrophe for one group of living things, however, may create opportunities for another group. Following each mass extinction, there is a sudden evolutionary burst as new species develop to fill the ecological niches opened by the event. 

   Impacts by meteorites represent one mechanism that could cause global catastrophes and seriously influence the evolution of life all over the planet. According to some estimates, the majority of all extinctions of species may be due to such impacts. Such a perspective fundamentally changes our view of biological evolution. The standard criterion for the survival of a species is its success in competing with other species and adapting to slowly changing environments. Yet an equally important criterion is the ability of a species to survive random global ecological catastrophes due to impacts. 

   Earth is a target in a cosmic shooting gallery, subject to random violent events that were unsuspected a few decades ago. In 1991 the United States Congress asked NASA to investigate the hazard posed today by large impacts on Earth. The group conducting the study concluded from a detailed analysis that impacts from meteorites can indeed be hazardous. Although there is always some risk that a large impact could occur, careful study shows that this risk is quite small.

   Michael: And here's the question.

     Answer choices 
     1.Scientists had believed for centuries that meteorite activity influenced evolution on Earth. 
     2.The site of the large meteorite impact at the end of the Cretaceous period was identified in 1990. 
     3.There have also been large meteorite impacts on the surface of the Moon, leaving craters like Tycho. 
     4.An iridium-enriched sediment layer and a large impact crater in the Yucatán provide evidence that a large meteorite struck Earth about 65 million years ago. 
     5.Large meteorite impacts, such as one at the end of the Cretaceous period, can seriously affect climate, ecological niches, plants, and animals. 
     6.Meteorite impacts can be advantageous for some species, which thrive, and disastrous for other species, which become extinct.

     Michael: Now let's look at each of the answer choices to see which three are correct.
      Answer #1 isn't supported by any of the information in the passage, so we know that this one is not correct.

     On-screen: [first answer option is highlighted]Scientists had believed for centuries that meteorite activity influenced evolution on Earth. [red x appears next to answer option]
     Michael: Answer #2 is a factually correct statement, but identifying the specific date when something happened generally doesn't qualify as one of the most important ideas. So this one is probably not correct, but let's look at the others to make sure. 

     On-screen: [second answer option is highlighted]The site of the large meteorite impact at the end of the Cretaceous period was identified in 1990. [faded red x appears next to answer option ]
     Michael: For answer #3, the reference to the crater Tycho is used to give a sense of the size of the crater that struck the Yucatán. However, the topic of meteorite activity on the moon is not a focus of this passage.

     On-screen: [third answer option is highlighted] There have also been large meteorite impacts on the surface of the Moon, leaving craters like Tycho. [red x appears next to answer option]
     Michael: Answer #4 combines several facts that together provide a summary of an important idea from the passage. This is supported by information given in paragraphs 2 and 3. 

     On-screen: [fourth answer option is highlighted] An iridium-enriched sediment layer and a large impact crater in the Yucatán provide evidence that a large meteorite struck Earth about 65 million years ago.  [green check appears next to answer option]

     [passage excerpt comes on screen with highlighted text]
      If an impact is large enough, it can disturb the environment of the entire Earth and cause an ecological catastrophe. The best-documented such impact took place 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period of geological history. This break in Earth's history is marked by a mass extinction, when as many as half the species on the planet became extinct. While there are a dozen or more mass extinctions in the geological record, the Cretaceous mass extinction has always intrigued paleontologists because it marks the end of the age of the dinosaurs.

By 1990 geologists had located the impact site itself in the Yucatán region of Mexico. The crater, now deeply buried in sediment, was originally about 200 kilometers in diameter. 
      Michael: Answer #5 is about the effects of meteorite impacts, which is an important idea of the passage. We can see this in paragraph 4, where it talks about the mass destruction from the cold, darkness and fires. And in paragraph 5 where it talks about the catastrophic results.

      On-screen: [fifth answer option is highlighted] Large meteorite impacts, such as one at the end of the Cretaceous period, can seriously affect climate, ecological niches, plants, and animals. [green check appears next to answer option]

        Michael: Answer #6 is another important idea that is stated in a similar sentence in paragraph 5: ‘What is a catastrophe for one group of living things, however, may create opportunities for another group."

        On-screen: [sixth answer option is highlighted] Meteorite impacts can be advantageous for some species, which thrive, and disastrous for other species, which become extinct. [green check appears next to answer option]

- Let's talk about how ETS determines scores
for the Reading and Listening sections of the test.
Most of the questions in the Reading and Listening sections
are standard multiple choice questions
with one correct answer and are worth one point.
Some questions in these sections have two
correct answers, but these question are also
worth one point.
A small number of questions in the Reading
and Listening sections can be worth more
than one point.
The number of possible points you can get
will be stated in the directions for these questions.
The good news is, if a question is worth
two or more points, it means you can get some credit
for answering part of the question correctly.
The number of questions you answer correctly
in each of these sections is what we call a raw score.
Statisticians then conduct analyses to convert
the raw score into a scaled score, between zero and 30.
Why is that important?
Scaled scores allow for comparisons of forms
of the test given on different dates
with different questions.
That means that your Reading and Listening scores
will accurately reflect your reading and listening ability
regardless of which test form you get on test day.

Reading review

(♪Music♪)
- Over the course of this week,
  we showed you an insider's view of the Reading Section.
  We started the week by looking at the features
  of an academic reading,
  and we showed you some examples
  of readings you can expect to see on test day
  and in a university classroom.
  We learned that academic texts
  generally use formal language
  and present material in logical and objective ways.
  We also talked about how to approach a reading passage,
  providing you with tips to help with academic reading.
  An important technique we talked about this week
  was skimming.
  It's also important to remember
  that it's not necessary to understand
  every detail of a reading passage.
  What is important is that you understand
  the main ideas.
  Throughout this week we learned about
  the different question types
  in the Reading Section of the TOEFL test.
  These include fact and vocabulary questions,
  inference questions and sentence simplification questions.
  Finally, we ended the week by practicing
  with real questions from past TOEFL tests.
  Next week we'll focus on the
  Listening section of the test
  with your instructor, Insook.
  You'll learn about the question types
  in the Listening section and we'll share tips
  to help you improve your listening skills.
  Be sure to ask us any questions you have about Listening
  in the discussion board.
  An example of a question could be,
  "How do I identify important information while listening?"
  We'll see you next week.
