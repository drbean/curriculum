      identifier: The Rise of Teotihuacan. Questions 1-10
      quiz:
        - question: |+
            ## The Rise of TeotihuacÃ¡ (from https://www.ets.org/s/toefl/pdf/reading_practice_sets.pdf)

            The city of TeotihuacÃ¡n, which lay about 50 kilometers northeast of modern-day Mexico City, began its growth by 200 â100 B.C. At its height, between about A.D. 150 and 700, it probably had a population of more than 125,000 people and covered at least 20 square kilometers. It had over 2,000 apartment complexes, a great market, a large number of industrial workshops, an administrative center, a number of massive religious edifices, and a regular grid pattern of streets and buildings. Clearly, much planning and central control were involved in the expansion and ordering of this great metropolis. Moreover, the city had economic and perhaps religious contacts with most parts of Mesoamerica (modern Central America and Mexico).

            How did this tremendous development take place, and why did it happen in the TeotihuacÃ¡n Valley? Among the main factors are TeotihuacÃ¡n's geographic location on a natural trade route to the south and east of the Valley of Mexico, the obsidian[1] resources in the TeotihuacÃ¡n Valley itself, and the valley's potential for extensive irrigation. The exact role of other factors is much more difficult to pinpoint -- for instance, TeotihuacÃ¡n's religious significance as a shrine, the historical situation in and around the Valley of Mexico toward the end of the first millennium B.C., the ingenuity and foresightedness of TeotihuacÃ¡n's elite, and, finally, the impact of natural disasters, such as the volcanic eruptions of the late first millennium B.C.

            This last factor is at least circumstantially implicated in TeotihuacÃ¡n's rise. Prior to 200 B.C., a number of relatively small centers coexisted in and near the Valley of Mexico. Around this time, the largest of these centers, Cuicuilco, was seriously affected by a volcanic eruption, with much of its agricultural land covered by lava. With Cuicuilco eliminated as a potential rival, any one of a number of relatively modest towns might have emerged as a leading economic and political power in Central Mexico. The archaeological evidence clearly indicates, though, that TeotihuacÃ¡n was the center that did arise as the predominant force in the area by the first century A.D.

            It seems likely that TeotihuacÃ¡n's natural resources--along with the city elite's ability to recognize their potential -- gave the city a competitive edge over its neighbors. The valley, like many other places in Mexican and Guatemalan highlands, was rich in obsidian. The hard volcanic stone was a resource that had been in great demand for many years, at least since the rise of the Olmecs (a people who flourished between 1200 and 400 B.C.), and it apparently had a secure market. Moreover, recent research on obsidian tools found at Olmec sites has shown that some of the obsidian obtained by the Olmecs originated near TeotihuacÃ¡n. TeotihuacÃ¡n obsidian must have been recognized as a valuable commodity for many centuries before the great city arose.

            Long-distance trade in obsidian probably gave the elite residents of TeotihuacÃ¡n access to a wide variety of exotic goods, as well as a relatively prosperous life. Such success may have attracted immigrants to TeotihuacÃ¡n. In addition, TeotihuacÃ¡n's elite may have consciously attempted to attract new inhabitants. It is also probable that as early as 200 B.C. TeotihuacÃ¡n may have achieved some religious significance and its shrine (or shrines) may have served as an additional population magnet. Finally, the growing population was probably fed by increasing the number and size of irrigated fields.

            The picture of TeotihuacÃ¡n that emerges is a classic picture of positive feedback among obsidian mining and working, trade, population growth, irrigation, and religious tourism. The thriving obsidian operation, for example, would necessitate more miners, additional manufacturers of obsidian tools, and additional traders to carry the goods to new markets. All this led to increased wealth, which in turn would attract more immigrants to TeotihuacÃ¡n. The growing power of the elite, who controlled the economy, would give them the means to physically coerce people to move to TeotihuacÃ¡n and serve as additions to the labor force. More irrigation works would have to be built to feed the growing population, and this resulted in more power and wealth for the elite.

            ## Pastoralism in Ancient Inner Eurasia

            Map of Eurasia (omitted)

            Pastoralism is a lifestyle in which economic activity is based primarily on livestock. Archaeological evidence suggests that by 3,000 B.C., and perhaps even earlier, there had emerged on the steppes of Inner Eurasia the distinctive types of pastoralism that were to dominate the regionâs history for several millennia. Here, the horse was already becoming the animal of prestige in many regions, though sheep, goats, and cattle could also play a vital role. It is the use of horses for transportation and warfare that explains why Inner Eurasian pastoralism proved the most mobile and the most militaristic of all major forms of pastoralism. The emergence and spread of pastoralism had a profound impact on the history of Inner Eurasia, and also, indirectly, on the parts of Asia and Europe just outside this area. In particular, pastoralism favors a mobile lifestyle, and this mobility helps to explain the impact of pastoralist societies on this part of the world.

            The mobility of pastoralist societies reflects their dependence on animal-based foods. While agriculturalists rely on domesticated plants, pastoralists rely on domesticated animals. As a result, pastoralists, like carnivores in general, occupy a higher position on the food chain. All else being equal, this means they must exploit larger areas of land than do agriculturalists to secure the same amount of food, clothing, and other necessities. So pastoralism is a more extensive lifeway than farming is. However, the larger the terrain used to support a group, the harder it is to exploit that terrain while remaining in one place. So, basic ecological principles imply a strong tendency within pastoralist lifeways toward nomadism (a mobile lifestyle). As the archaeologist Roger Cribb puts it, âThe greater the degree of pastoralism, the stronger the tendency toward nomadism.â A modern Turkic nomad interviewed by Cribb commented: âThe more animals you have, the farther you have to move.â

            Nomadism has further consequences. It means that pastoralist societies occupy and can influence very large territories. This is particularly true of the horse pastoralism that emerged in the Inner Eurasian steppes, for this was the most mobile of all major forms of pastoralism. So, it is no accident that with the appearance of pastoralist societies there appear large areas that share similar cultural, ecological, and even linguistic features. By the late fourth millennium B.C., there is already evidence of large culture zones reaching from Eastern Europe to the western borders of Mongolia. Perhaps the most striking sign of mobility is the fact that by the third millennium B.C., most pastoralists in this huge region spoke related languages ancestral to the modern Indo-European languages. The remarkable mobility and range of pastoral societies explain, in part, why so many linguists have argued that the Indo-European languages began their astonishing expansionist career not among farmers in Anatolia (present-day Turkey), but among early pastoralists from Inner Eurasia. Such theories imply that the Indo-European languages evolved not in Neolithic (10,000 to 3,000 B.C.) Anatolia, but among the foraging communities of the cultures in the region of the Don and Dnieper rivers, which took up stock breeding and began to exploit the neighboring steppes. 

            Nomadism also subjects pastoralist communities to strict rules of portability. If you are constantly on the move, you cannot afford to accumulate large material surpluses. Such rules limit variations in accumulated material goods between pastoralist households (though they may also encourage a taste for portable goods of high value such as silks or jewelry). So, by and large, nomadism implies a high degree of self-sufficiency and inhibits the appearance of an extensive division of labor. Inequalities of wealth and rank certainly exist, and have probably existed in most pastoralist societies, but except in periods of military conquest, they are normally too slight to generate the stable, hereditary hierarchies that are usually implied by the use of the term class. Inequalities of gender have also existed in pastoralist societies, but they seem to have been softened by the absence of steep hierarchies of wealth in most communities, and also by the requirement that women acquire most of the skills of men, including, often, their military skills.

            Question 3. According to paragraph 2, pastoralists tend to
          option:
            - prefer grazing their animals on agricultural lands
            - consume comparatively large amounts of food and clothing
            - avoid eating plant foods
            - move from place to place frequently

            Summary Box: By 3,000 B.C., a distinctive form of pastoralism had appeared on the steppes of Inner Eurasia. List three bullet points.

            A. The domesticated horse is primarily responsible for Inner Eurasian pastoralismâs success in mobility and warfare.
            B. Because pastoralism requires a great deal of land to support its animal-based lifeway, pastoralists must continually relocate and have comparatively egalitarian societies.
            C. As pastoralists traveled across large areas of terrain with their domesticated animals, they traded valuable material goods such as silks and jewelry.
            D. Most scholars now believe that Indo-European languages probably evolved during the Neolithic period in the region of the Don and Dnieper rivers.
            E. Because pastoralists are highly mobile, they tend to have few material possessions and can influence the culture, ecology, and language of very large areas.
            F. Pastoralist communities do not have social classes in the usual sense because they value spiritual attainment over material wealth.
