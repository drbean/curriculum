The first section of the TOEFL iBT®  test is the Reading section.

This section uses reading passages from university-level textbooks that introduce a topic. The passages may have been changed slightly to make them appropriate for testing purposes, but they are real academic materials.

Topics of the reading passages can vary, but you do not need to have any prior knowledge of the topics. Everything you need to know to answer the questions is in the passages, because the questions are testing your English skills, not your knowledge of the topic.

There are 3 or 4 reading passages of about 700 words each. For each passage, there are 10 multiple-choice questions. You will be able to see the reading passage as you answer each question.

Most questions have four choices and a single correct answer. Some questions ask you to select two or more correct answers from a larger group of choices.

You will have 54 to 72 minutes to complete the Reading section. During that time, you can return to previous questions to review or change your answers.

You will learn more details about the Reading section this week through a series of videos about the different Reading question types.

Tips

Tips

There are several key skills that you’ll need to be successful in the Reading section. You should be able to: 

1.  Synthesize information presented in the text 

This means that you can read chunks of text and identify main ideas being expressed. You should be able to draw connections between individual sentences and paraphrase the information that is presented.

2.  Identify the author’s rhetorical purpose

When you read a piece of information, you should be able to understand why the author has included it. Is it an example of a phenomenon, a supporting detail for an argument, or perhaps the introduction of a new idea? Understanding the structure of each paragraph and the whole passage is critical to understanding its contents. 

3.  Scan the text to find specific pieces of information

In order to put together the big picture about what’s going on in a passage, you will also need to comprehend the little pieces that fit together to make that big picture. It is important to be able to quickly locate a sentence or portion of a paragraph that discusses a particular point. Once you’ve found that sentence, you can re-read it in order to understand exactly what is being expressed.

4.  Understand academic vocabulary used in the passage

A newspaper or magazine article might use more everyday language—the sort of thing you hear in conversations and read in emails. But an academic text, regardless of the subject, contains certain vocabulary that is standard in academic discourse. There might be words related to presenting theories: "propose", "hypothesis", "scenario". Or there could be words that connect two sentences: "however", "in addition", "thus". A good reader should be familiar with this type of vocabulary.

rhetorical/purpose questions

More About the Rhetorical Purpose Sample Question


In the Rhetorical Purpose question in the video, the correct answer choice is C. Toward the end of the paragraph, the author mentions that the dinosaur extinctions have always “intrigued” paleontologists. We find out why they were so intrigued in the next two sentences: they were intrigued because the extinctions came so suddenly and occurred even though the dinosaurs had been flourishing for a long time. So the author includes that information in order to explain why the Cretaceous extinction has always been so intriguing.

Answer choices A, B, and D all include correct statements from the paragraph, but they cannot be correct answers to this question because none of them states the author’s reason (the rhetorical purpose) for telling us that the dinosaurs flourished then suddenly disappeared.

Answer choice A is incorrect because nothing else in the paragraph supports the author’s statement that the Cretaceous extinction is the “best-documented” of the large extinctions. While that statement may be true, it is not related to the information asked about in the question (about how long the dinosaurs had lasted and then how quickly they disappeared).

Answer choice B is incorrect because it states a fact about the Cretaceous extinction but does not tell us why the author includes the information that this particular extinction was very sudden.

Answer choice D is incorrect because it does not relate specifically to the idea of why scientists have always been interested in this particular mass extinction. Rather, it relates to the first sentence of the paragraph discussing the harm that large impacts can cause. That information is important, but it is not the reason why the author talks about the suddenness of the dinosaur extinctions.
