# The opportunity to teach TOEFL®

## On setting up this online course

I am very happy to have been given this opportunity to develop a teach-yourself TOEFL® site. I think it is a good test because the questions replicate the kind of experience you will have in American and other English-speaking countries' classrooms.

The test will give you an idea of how difficult studying at an American university will be. If you can do the test successfully, you will be able to do well in American classrooms. If you struggle with the test, you will find studying in the US difficult too.

Your results on the test are not just a gatekeeping device used by schools to arbitrarily decide whether to admit you or reject you. They also are useful for you telling you how prepared you are for studying in an English language environment.

I haven't done the test (I did the GRE 30 years ago) so if you have done the 
test I would appreciate you telling me and the other students what you thought 
of it.

# Practice tests

## Midterm, final tests

The plan is to simulate the TOEFL test experience under test conditions at certain points of the course on the Internet.

I will try to grade your answers the way an actual test rater would score you.

# Looking for sample tests

## Extra credit for students posting links to testing material

Please post links to online TOEFL and IELTS speaking/writing tests

Or books with TOEFL speaking/writing tests.

In the subject line, 2~3 word description, eg Testden test

In the message itself, write the link, eg http:example.com/test/practice_test.pdf

If it is in a book, give the name of the book and authors.

## Student use of *tell*

We need to use imagination and information to create complete sentences in the test, so the more information we can write means the more complete sentences we can *tell* in the test.

* 'Can you tell me the time?', or
* 'I told her I loved her.'

# Material from the edX TOEFL® Test Preparation: The Insider’s Guide

## Introduction to the TOEFL test

The TOEFL Test has four sections, Reading, Listening, Speaking, and Writing. All four sections are completed in one testing session, with three hours of testing time.

The first section is Reading.

The Reading section has three or four passages of about 700 words each.
For each passage, you will answer 10 multiple choice questions.
You will have 54 to 72 minutes to complete the Reading section. During that time, you can return to previous questions to review or change your answers.

Next, is the Listening section.

For this section, you will wear a headset to hear the conversations and lectures.
There are 2 or 3 conversations. Each is about 3 minutes long and has 5 multiple choice questions.
There are 3 or 4 lectures, each of those about 3 to 5 minutes long and has 6 multiple choice questions.
In the Listening section, you will only hear the conversations and lectures one time. Also, you must answer the questions in the order that they are presented. In this section, you can't go back to previous questions.
You will have 41 to 57 minutes to complete the section.
You probably noticed that in the Reading and Listening sections, the testing time and number of questions can vary. That is because every test includes some extra questions that are being evaluated by ETS for use in future tests and do not count toward your score.

So, your test will either have extra Reading questions or extra Listening questions, but never both. And you won't know which questions are the extra ones, so make sure you do your best on all of them.

After the Listening section, there is a required 10-minute break. So use the time to have some water or a snack and refresh yourself for the rest of the test.

After the break is the Speaking section.

The Speaking section has four tasks and takes about 17 minutes to complete.
Some tasks require you to listen to part of a conversation or lecture, so you will continue to use your headset. Some also require you to read a short passage.

For each task, you will be asked a question and will be given a short time to prepare your response. Then, you will speak into the microphone on your headset for 45 to 60 seconds, depending on the question.

Last is the Writing section.

You will complete two writing tasks in 50 minutes by typing your responses into the computer.
In the first task, you will read a passage and listen to a short lecture, then write your response. You will have 20 minutes to write your response.
In the second task, you will be asked your opinion on an issue and you will have 30 minutes to write your response.
