      identifier: 100 words about my experience with Japanese, Korean and Chinese
      rubric: |+
        I spent 6 years in Japan, 12 in Korea and 20 in Taiwan. Although the FSI says they are all among the most difficult languages in the world to learn well, I think Japanese is the easiest of the three. I never/rarely had people not understanding what I said there (although my pronunciation was not good). There are only 52 sounds in Japanese.

        Korean pronunciation is more difficult. Many times in Korea people could not understand my pronunciation. I have the same problem here in Taiwan though the 4 tones is responsible for some of those problems.

        The big problem learning Chinese is Chinese characters. In Korean and to a lesser degree in Japanese, reading and listening work together to help learners. With Chinese however, hearing the word and seeing the same word as a Chinese character, it is harder to connect the two.

        I remember in older versions of the FSI scale of language difficulty that Korean was regarded as a little more difficult than Chinese. It took longer to learn. And Japanese was not included in the most difficult languages.

        So in my opinion, a good order for speakers of English is Japanese, Chinese, Korean.
