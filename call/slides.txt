## The Internet as a way to learn English

- Pros:
	- Same experience as in US (if you use English in your browser).

- Cons:
	- Unnatural, not as close, intimate as face-to-face. No body language.
	- Communication is narrow, restricted.
	- Disables learners. Like blind people,
	learners-  have to use machines to work around their disability.
	- Breaks easily. Not permanent. Web pages disappear. It's harder to lose books or CD's.

## Identity on the Internet

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Internet,_nobody_knows_you%27re_a_dog

'dog' can have many meanings: good, as in the cartoon

or bad: eg, it can mean an ugly woman or man:

- [http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dog ](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=dog)
 

- What identity do you have on the Internet?
- What character do you portray on the Internet?

## Care needed on the Internet

Like in real life,

- [viruses ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/virus)
- [hackers ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hacker)
- [scams ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/scam)
- [spam ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/spam)

## Internet use

- Finding information
- Facebook
- Keeping in touch
- Chat
- Playing games
- Movies
- Music
- Shopping

## Internet activities in class

-	Recording webcam videos and uploading them
-	Downloading soundfiles, transcribing them and writing questions
-	ESL chat rooms (text, not skype)
-	Internet surveys?
-	Blogs eg Twitter (no Facebook)

## urbandictionary homework

New word

## LiveABC

- [應外系LIVE ABC 專用網址(Liveabc英檢網專用帳號：學號、密碼：1234) http://120.105.49.211/livegept/ ](http://120.105.49.211/livegept/)

Department competition

[Dr Shia ](http://acade.must.edu.tw/03_teacher.aspx?UnitID=30502) recommends we do some Liveabc activity, CNN perhaps, to prepare for the competition.

## Homework: Find an interesting exercise on LiveABC

post a description of an exercise which will help prepare for the GEPT, on 

- [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/internet_english](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/internet_english)
- [You can start from](http://drbean.freeshell.org)


For homework, look at the site and choose an activity, write the title in a post to the Internet_english google group. Include your name and ID.

The week after, we will choose the activity which everyone will do for homework.

## Homework

[Dr Shia ](http://acade.must.edu.tw/03_teacher.aspx?UnitID=30502) says, besides LiveABC, and CNN in particular, there are other Internet resources at Minghsin, eg for practicing TOEIC, etc.

Post a link on ec.must.edu.tw to a particular exercise on one of these sites, and post a screenshot of the question and your answer to the exercise.

If someone has already done one exercise on a site, you cannot do another exercise in the same section on that site. You must choose a different section.



## Self-introductions not uploaded

Dr Shia said you had some concerns. But he didn't really say what those concerns were.

The previous week, one student said she didn't want her self-introduction in a public place, why, I'm not too sure.

I myself try to keep my name, Greg Matheson, off my Internet presence as Dr Bean.

Are you willing to post a message expressing your concerns on the Internet_english google group?

Would you be happier if the videos or links were on ec.must.edu.tw?

I am not really keen on using ec, if we can put them on google and youtube.

Was:

Do it before next week (next Tuesday morning 8am, March 4), or lose points

You are preventing your group from doing the homework
for week 2.

## Classwork Week 15

- Find some kind of way of communicating with people outside 臺灣, eg chat, email, website.
- Send a message to as many sites as you can.

## Message to send

Just an example. Do it the way you want.

	"Hi. I am a student from Taiwan.

	I've been thinking about X.

	I think X is y, a, and b. Because it/she/he is c, d, and e.

	I'm really f, g, and h about X.

	What do you think?

	Name"

## Homework Week 15

A reply from someone to one of your messages posted as classwork in Week 15.

With a link, or copy posted on ec.must.edu.tw. I will open the site after the clas is over.

- [kiss and tell](http://www.google.com.tw/search?q=%22kiss+and+tell%22&num=100)


## Sit back and wait till communications roll in.

- They won't roll in.
  	- Perhaps they are not interested in your topic.
	- Perhaps they are shy.
	- Perhaps they feel you aren't a member of the group.
- Think about how you can get in touch with the thinking of the group.

## Recommendation for one discussion forum

- One or more persons from each group comes to front 
- Introduces discussion forum
  	- types of messages, eg on a clothes site: about jackets, pants
	- participants eg fashion designers, clothes buyers
	- types of communications eg light/heavy, conversational/academic, short/long, etc
	- number of messages eg many messages a day, 1 or 2 a month
	- types of interaction eg long-running threads/little response to individual messages

## Unhappy about Week 14 homework

You have 5 minutes to post an answer on http://ec.must.edu.tw

## What do the posts of the women have in common and the one guy, Oliver's, not?
## What do Peggy's post and Betty and Emily's messages have in common?
## What do Avis's post and Betty and Emily's replies have in common?
## Is http://thethingamongst.us an appropriate place for Emily's message about Taiwan?
## Why might the website staff have removed replies to Betty's messages about surfing in Bali?

[Local Style - Best Surf Breaks in Bali Indonesia, Episode 9 ](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_azIoZ50zuM)

- One message was removed by the author's request.
- Two messages were regarded as inappropriate.

## Why did staff want Emily to repost her message about places to go in NY?

## Classwork Week 16 (no class Week 17)

- Post on ec chat content
- As many questions as possible about the questions on http://ec.must.edu.tw

## Final exam--same form as Midterm about Simon and Ariel

But the content will be about the chat in class on Week 16.

"Does Simon's partner say that they are in Switzerland"

Yes/No

The questions must be grammatical.

One point for a question.

Two points for a grammatical question.

Three points for a grammatical question with a correct answer.

The person with most points get a perfect final grade. (But finals are only worth 10 percent of overall grade.)

Everyone who attends gets at least 60 percent.

Non-attenders get zero.

## Homework Week 16

Send email to drbean@freeshell.org, asking when the site is ready to start practicing for the exam

I will reply with the address when there is something you can do on the site.
