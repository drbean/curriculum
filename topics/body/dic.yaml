    M: Hi, Sandy. I have a question for you.
    W: Sure, Joe.
    M: I need to have a physical examination, and there is a new clinic on Elm Street. Have you heard anything about it?
    W: One of my friends went there recently. She said it was very hygienic and well-run. It is great to have a new clinic close by, since there is a shortage of doctors around here. Why are you going?
    M: I've just joined a gym. I want to get more exercise, and they require a medical exam before I can start.

    W: What kind of tests do they want you to have?
    M: They want to know my blood pressure, how much I weigh, and results from a blood test to check for any possible diseases. I feel terrific, so I'm not worried.
    W: I had a routine check-up last month, and the doctor discovered that my blood pressure is a little high. It's not serious, but I'm glad I found out about it. I am walking every day, and I have cut down on my salt intake. I would rather not take medication if I don't have to. The change in diet has really made me feel better. You know the saying, "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
    M: I think you are right. Prevention is very important. I'm going to call right now and set up an appointment.

    We all need regular exercise to keep fit. But if we study all day, we don't have time to run, swim, lift weights, or play basketball. What can we do to stay in shape?
    One thing we could do is walk more often. Walking is good exercise. Instead of going to school by car or bus, we could walk. During recess, we could go outside and stroll around before we go back to class. Instead of taking the elevator in buildings all the time, we could use the stairs.

    A: Another important thing to do is to take breaks from studying. If we sit at our desks or in front of a computer for a long time, we should stand up and stretch our arms and legs once each hour.
    B:  If we stand for a long time, we should sit down and stretch our backs. These are just a few ways we can stay fit when we don't have a lot of time to exercise. Do you know some other ways?

    W: Stop yawning, Jason.
    B: I'm sorry, Ms Terry. I can't help it.
    W: You can! You yawn because your lungs need more oxygen. When you need more oxygen, you open your mouth wide and take in a lot of air.
    B: What can I do to stop yawning?
    W: You should go outside into the fresh air and breathe deeply.

    W: Then you won't need to yawn anymore. Your lungs will have lots of oxygen.
    B: We just came in from recess, so why am I yawning?
    W: Are you tired? Being tired also makes you yawn. This is because your body needs rest. Oxygen helps your body rest. Sleeping rests your body and makes you take deep, long breaths.
    B: Then, why do I yawn when I am bored, Ms Terry?
    W: Well, Jason, when you are bored, you are probably not breathing deeply enough. The best way to stop yawning from boredom is to do something interesting. If you can't do that, try taking deep breaths. This will not stop the boredom, but it will help you stop yawning..

    Acupuncture began in China thousands of years ago. It is a special way to treat sick people.
    There are many acupuncture spots on the human body. Small metal needles are put into spots on the body. Each spot is connected to a special body part or system. There are many spots for each part.
    An expert puts the needles into these spots in a person's body. These spots connect to the body system that has a problem. The needles do not go deep. People say that the needles do not hurt.
    We are not sure why acupuncture works. But studies have shown that it works very well. No one can explain why.

    Doctors think that it helps the nerves in the body. Some doctors use acupuncture to treat people who cannot take medicine.
    People in Asia have been using this special method for a long time. At first, people outside Asia did not trust this method. They did not think that it would help them. Now, it has become very popular around the world.

    G: Your blood type is a combination of genes from your father and your mother.
    M: That's right.
    G: Before the lecture, I always thought that all blood was the same. Why can't two different blood types mix?
    M: In some ways, every person's blood is the same. But it is very dangerous to mix two different blood types. Your blood cells may begin to stick together. If you are given the wrong type of blood in a hospital, you could die.
    G: I see. So, that's why blood types must be matched in the hospital. And this must be done before blood is given to anyone.
    M: Exactly!
