    M: Hi, Sandy. I have a question for you.
    W: Sure, Joe.
    M: I need to have a physical examination, and there is a new clinic on Elm Street. Have you heard anything about it?
    W: One of my friends went there recently. She said it was very hygienic and well-run. It is great to have a new clinic close by, since there is a shortage of doctors around here. Why are you going?
    M: I've just joined a gym. I want to get more exercise, and they require a medical exam before I can start.

    W: What kind of tests do they want you to have?
    M: They want to know my blood pressure, how much I weigh, and results from a blood test to check for any possible diseases. I feel terrific, so I'm not worried.
    W: I had a routine check-up last month, and the doctor discovered that my blood pressure is a little high. It's not serious, but I'm glad I found out about it. I am walking every day, and I have cut down on my salt intake. I would rather not take medication if I don't have to. The change in diet has really made me feel better. You know the saying, "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
    M: I think you are right. Prevention is very important. I'm going to call right now and set up an appointment.

    Holly doesn't like her hair color. She has blond hair. It's long and straight.

    She changes it. Now, her hair is brown. It's short and curly.

    But she still doesn't like it. She doesn't want short hair anymore.

    Holly will have to wait for her hair to grow long again.
