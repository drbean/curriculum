    M: Hi, Sandy. I have a question for you.
    W: Sure, Joe.
    M: I need to have a physical examination, and there is a new clinic on Elm Street. Have you heard anything about it?
    W: One of my friends went there recently. She said it was very hygienic and well-run. It is great to have a new clinic close by, since there is a shortage of doctors around here. Why are you going?
    M: I've just joined a gym. I want to get more exercise, and they require a medical exam before I can start.

    W: What kind of tests do they want you to have?
    M: They want to know my blood pressure, how much I weigh, and results from a blood test to check for any possible diseases. I feel terrific, so I'm not worried.
    W: I had a routine check-up last month, and the doctor discovered that my blood pressure is a little high. It's not serious, but I'm glad I found out about it. I am walking every day, and I have cut down on my salt intake. I would rather not take medication if I don't have to. The change in diet has really made me feel better. You know the saying, "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure."
    M: I think you are right. Prevention is very important. I'm going to call right now and set up an appointment.
