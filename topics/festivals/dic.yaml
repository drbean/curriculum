    B: Hi, Mom! Guess what? We got our English test back today. I got the highest score in my class!
    W: Oh, Billy. I'm glad you did so well! You worked hard for that test.
    B: Thanks, Mom. I'm hungry. What's for dinner?
    W: We're going to your aunt's place for dinner tonight. It's your grandfather's birthday today, remember?
    B: Oh no, I forgot. I haven't got a birthday gift for Grandpa!
    W: Don't worry. I bought a gift for him.
