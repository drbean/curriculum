    A long time ago, people in Egypt wore wigs. They wore them to keep the sun off of their heads. This kept their skin from turning red.
    Later, people wore them to stay clean. Wigs kept bugs out of their hair.
    Today, people with no hair wear wigs. People also wear them when they dress up in costumes.

    M: Yes. What great costumes! A beautiful princess, a scary lion, and a cute puppy.

    W: Have you heard about the music festival next summer? I read that it is going to have about 20 different bands playing in it.
    M: I think I did hear someone talking about it. Are you planning on going?
    W: I'll go if I can get tickets. I heard that people are going to line up overnight to get tickets. I might line up overnight too.
    M: I don't think I want to line up all night long!
    W: Well, I'm going to do it. I think it's going to be a great music festival that I don't want to miss.
    M: Maybe. Do you know how much the tickets are going to cost?
    W: I'm not sure, but I think each ticket will be about 75 dollars.
    M: That's a lot of money! I don't think I want to spend that much on a ticket. Good luck, anyway!
