    A long time ago, people in Egypt wore wigs. They wore them to keep the sun off of their heads. This kept their skin from turning red.
    Later, people wore them to stay clean. Wigs kept bugs out of their hair.
    Today, people with no hair wear wigs. People also wear them when they dress up in costumes.
