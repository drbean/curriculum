    G: Oh no, it's raining! I wanted to go to the beach today.
    B: Well, I'm visiting a haunted house this afternoon. You can come with me if you like.
    G: A haunted house? What is it like?
    B: It's really dark, with lots of old furniture and pictures on the walls. It's called a haunted house because it's full of ghosts.
    G: You're joking, right? I don't believe in ghosts! Where is the haunted house?
    B: The house is in the old forest.
    G: Oh! Are you really sure you want to go?

    B: What's wrong? I thought you didn't believe in ghosts!
    G: Well, I don't really believe in ghosts, but ...
    B: That's OK. I don't believe in ghosts, either! I was only joking. The old house isn't really haunted; it's just a very old, empty house.
    G: Whew, I'm glad to hear that! Sure, I'll come with you.

    G: You've been studying for several days, Joe. You don't need to study anymore. You need to have fun because you're too tired to study, anyway.
    B: I don't know. Maybe you're right. Is it just Amy and us going?
    G: Lily is coming along, too.
    B: Really? I need time to take a shower and get dressed.
    G: Don't worry. You have time.
    B: It will be fun to see Lily and fun to watch a movie together.
