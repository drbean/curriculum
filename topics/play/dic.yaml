    G: Oh no, it's raining! I wanted to go to the beach today.
    B: Well, I'm visiting a haunted house this afternoon. You can come with me if you like.
    G: A haunted house? What is it like?
    B: It's really dark, with lots of old furniture and pictures on the walls. It's called a haunted house because it's full of ghosts.
    G: You're joking, right? I don't believe in ghosts! Where is the haunted house?
    B: The house is in the old forest.
    G: Oh! Are you really sure you want to go?

    B: What's wrong? I thought you didn't believe in ghosts!
    G: Well, I don't really believe in ghosts, but ...
    B: That's OK. I don't believe in ghosts, either! I was only joking. The old house isn't really haunted; it's just a very old, empty house.
    G: Whew, I'm glad to hear that! Sure, I'll come with you.
