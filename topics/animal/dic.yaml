    Kevin and Carla are at the zoo. They see polar bears and zebras first. Next, they go to the aquarium. They see a shark.
    It swims close to the glass.
    The shark opens its mouth. It has so many teeth! Carla screams. She's afraid of the shark. A man feeds the shark, and it swims away. "Don't be afraid. The shark is gone," Kevin says.

    G: I like monkeys. They are cute. What about you?
    B: I like lions.
    G: I don't like lions. They have big claws and teeth. They roar a lot, too.

    Many zoos have polar bears. Sometimes, zoos are too warm for polar bears.

    Why is this? Polar bears live in cold places. They like snow and ice.

    There is no snow at the zoo. So, zookeepers make snow for them. Snow helps keep the bears cool.

    Elephants are interesting. They are intelligent. They also have a great memory. You should always be kind to elephants. They remember everything. A woman from India told me a story. When she was little, she knew of an evil elephant keeper. He often hit his elephant. He was very mean and cruel to the elephant. Then the evil keeper sold the elephant. The new keeper was a very kind man. Many years later, the evil keeper met the elephant again. The elephant remembered the evil man.

    He picked up a stone with his trunk and threw it at the evil man. The elephant still knew the man, even after so many years.
    Elephants help each other too. Elephants use a special sound. The sound is so low that people cannot hear it. This sound travels really far. Groups of elephants can communicate with each other, even if they are far apart. this is very useful because it helps the elephants to find water and food. The elephants cooperate with each other.

    B: Mom, can I get a puppy?
    W: No, Billy. Taking care of a pet is a big responsibility.
    B: I promise to take good care of him, and you won't have to remind me to do things for him.
    W: A dog isn't a toy that you play with for a while. He will be part of your life for the next 10 or 20 years. He is a living creature.
    B: I understand that, Mom. I promise to feed him every morning and take him for a walk every afternoon.
    W: That's part of the responsibility, but there's more. He needs a license ...

    W: ... and has to go to the vet to get shots. A dog also needs companionship. You can't go off with your friends and leave him locked up in the house all day.
    B: I understand, Mom. I have almost \$100 in the bank so I can pay for his license and shots now.
    W: There are other expenses, too. Dog food is rather expensive.
    B: Well, I have my job mowing lawns and I'll get a newspaper route.
    W: I think we should discuss this with your father when he gets home. This is a family decision.

    G: Dogs make good pets. So do cats. What about beetles?

    Beetles are popular pets, too. Many people like them. Some people catch them. Or, they buy them in stores.

    Some beetles are small. Some are big. They eat plants and leaves. They also play with other beetles.

    However, there is one bad thing. They only live in the summer.
