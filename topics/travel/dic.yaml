    M: You are so lucky! What places are you going to visit?

    M: Oh, you're riding through the Rockies! That's really exciting!
    W: Then I'll fly to Toronto, and take a bus to Niagara Falls. Did you know that you can actually take a boat under that huge waterfall? It's called Maid of the Mist.
    M: Wow! That's an amazing thing to do! You're so lucky!
    W: Well, I hope I don't get seasick! I'll finish my trip in Nova Scotia. I want to eat lobster for dinner every night. And I'd like to bike around some small fishing villages, too.
    M: Have a great time, and take lots of pictures!

    B: I haven't seen you for two whole weeks! Where did you go on vacation?
    G: I visited my cousin in New Mexico. I had a great time!
    B: Mexico? I thought you went to the US.
    G: I did. New Mexico is a state in the southwestern US. It's between Texas and Arizona. Guess what? A lot of Americans don't know that New Mexico is a state.. The license plates on cars in New Mexico also say "USA." This is so that people don't get confused and think the driver is from Mexico.

    B: That's funny! So, tell me what did you do in New Mexico.
    G: My favorite part was visiting Carlsbad Caverns. There are 30 miles of caves. In one cave we had to wear hats with lights on them so we could see in the dark. Sometimes we had to crawl through very narrow tunnels on our hands and knees.
    B: Weren't you scared?
    G: No, it was a lot of fun! I"m going to visit my cousin again next year. You should come with me.

    There are only a few toilets and baths. People share them, too.
    Hostels are good place to meet other travelers. You can make friends. They can tell you about fun things to do in the area. Many hostels have kitchens. These kitchens have stoves. Some have toasters. You can buy your food from a store. Then, you can cook at the hostel. This is cheaper than eating out. Just remember to clean up when you are done.

    Trains were the fastest forms of transport from the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century, when freeways and airline services were developed. Their speed was not much less than trains today.

    In the 1950s, France started setting new rail speed records. Japanese rail engineers went to France to learn about the trains. They went back to Japan and built the Shinkansen, the 1st modern high-speed rail system.

    M: Sign up to climb Mt Fuji on Saturday.
    W: I didn't know about it. What is planned?
    M: It will take 2 days. The bus will drop us off at the bottom, and we'll hike to a cabin halfway up the mountain.
    W: What will we do when we get to the cabin?
    M: It'll take 7 hours to get there, so we'll unpack, light a campfire, sing, eat, and tell stories. The next day, we'll leave at dawn and hike to the top of the mountain. Then, after taking pictures, we'll hike back down. If we have time, we might go swimming in a lake.
    W: That sounds like really fun. I can't wait!
