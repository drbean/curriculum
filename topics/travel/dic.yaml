    A: I'm so excited! I just got back from the travel agency.
    B: Travel agency? Where are you going?
    A: I'm planning to go to Canada on vacation.
    B: Canada! How exciting! How long are you going for?
    A: I'm going for a month. I want to see as much as I can!
    B: You are so lucky! What places are you going to visit?
    A: First, I'll spend a few days in Vancouver. Then I'll take a train through the Rocky Mountains.

    B: Oh, you're riding through the Rockies! That's really exciting!
    A: Then I'll fly to Toronto, and take a bus to Niagara Falls. Did you know that you can actually take a boat under that huge waterfall? It's called Maid of the Mist.
    B: Wow! That's an amazing thing to do!
    A: Well, I hope I don't get seasick! I'll finish my trip in Nova Scotia. I want to eat lobster for dinner every night. And I'd like to bike around some small fishing villages, too.
    B: Have a great time, and take lots of pictures!

    G: I visited my cousin in New Mexico. I had a great time!
    B: Mexico? I thought you went to the US.
    G: I did. New Mexico is a state in the southwestern US. It's between Texas and Arizona. Guess what? A lot of Americans don't know that New Mexico is a state. The license plates on cars in New Mexico also say "USA." This is so that people don't get confused and think the driver is from Mexico.

    Traveling is a good hobby. If you have very little money, backpacking is a good way to travel. Many students like to backpack. They can travel cheaply. They can travel to many places. These travelers carry their belongings in large backpacks. They are called backpackers.
    Backpackers take buses or trains to save money. They camp outdoors to sleep. If they stay in a city, they may go to a hostel. A hostel is like a hotel. Hotels are not cheap. Hostels are very cheap. Travelers often share rooms at hostels.

    There are only a few toilets and baths. People share them, too.
    Hostels are a good place to meet other travelers. You can make friends. They can tell you about fun things to do in the area. Many hostels have kitchens. These kitchens have stoves. Some have toasters. You can buy your food from a store. Then, you can cook at the hostel. This is cheaper than eating out. Just remember to clean up when you are done.

    Trains were the fastest forms of transport from the 19th century to the middle of the 20th century, when freeways and airline services were developed. Their speed was not much less than trains today.

    In the 1950s, France started setting new rail speed records. Japanese rail engineers went to France to learn about the trains. They went back to Japan and built the Shinkansen, the 1st modern high-speed rail system.

    The air is fresh and you can swim in clear, clean lakes. I definitely recommend it.

    There are so many birds to see. It is fun to go into the forest with binoculars to look at birds. Seeing the birds through binoculars makes them seem much nearer than they actually are. You can write down all the species that you see. You should learn about their calls first. That means the sounds that each bird makes. Sometimes, it's hard to see the birds. However, you can identify the species them if you happen to hear them.

    I want to go back to Iran again someday. It's so beautiful that I want to see and explore much more of it.

Families can go to the movies, travel, visit museums and play sports together. The most common family activity is probably camping.
    Many families like camping. It is a chance for the whole family to work together. They can stay in the wild.

    Children gather dry wood for the fire. Their parents set up the tents. Then the whole family gathers around the fire. They enjoy a special meal together. Then, they set off into the woods with a compass and a map. After hiking the trails, everyone gets a fishing pole. Each person casts the fishing line out into the river. Who gets the biggest fish? It's a great contest. Later, the children clean the fish by the river. They take the scales off the fish.

    A while ago, I arranged to meet my friend at a new mall. My friend had been there before and said that we should shop there together. We planned to meet at 3pm at Burger Palace there.
    When I arrived at the mall, I realized that I did not know where Burger Palace was, so I asked a woman how to get there. She advised me to go straight past the bank, and turn right before the foodcourt. She mentioned that I would walk for a few minutes, passing a shoe store until I reached Burger Palace, which was next to the bookstore.

At around 3:40pm, I saw my friend walking quickly toward me. I rushed to him and demanded to know what had happened. "I was at the other Burger Palace!" he cried. We had not realized there were two Burger Palaces in the mall.
    Since then, I have made sure that I get the directions from my friends before I go to meet them. It saves me a lot of trouble!

    When your car gets a flat tire, do not panic.

    First, apply your brakes and pull over. Inside the trunk, you will find a spare tire and a toolbox.

    One of the tools is a jack, which is a tool you use to raise a car. This makes the tire easy to remove. Position the jack beneath the car, behind the tire that is flat. Insert the jack handle and turn it clockwise. Continue turning the handle until the car rises high enough, so that the flat tire is well off the ground and spins freely. Make sure that the jack is securely supporting the vehicle. If the car is unsteady or the jack is unstable, lower the car. Reposition the jack and start again.

    Next, use a crowbar to pry off the hubcap (the metal cover on the side of the tire).

    Inside the hubcap are four bolts that hold the tire in place. Loosen these, using the long L-shaped tool. Push firmly on the tool to get the bolts to turn. It may be difficult.

    Once the bolts are loose, the flat tire can be pulled off easily. Now you can put on the new tire. Once it is in place, replace the four bolts and tighten them. Place the flat tire and the toolbox back in the trunk.

    Finally drive to the nearest service station and get your flat tire fixed!
