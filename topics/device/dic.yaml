    W: I need to check my messages.
    M: How are going to do that? We are in the middle of the freeway!
    W: I'm going to use my cell phone. Haven't you ever done that?
    M: No. I just use my cell phone to talk to other people.
    W: Now you can also use a cell phone to send and receive short text messages. It's very useful.
    M: How do you send messages that way?
    W: I just use the keys on the phone to type a short message. Then I press the "send" button. It's cheaper than making a phone call.
    M: That's a great idea! You can save both time and money that way.
    W: Right. All my friends usually send me text messages now.
    M: Thanks for telling me about this. I'll have to try it!
    W: You're welcome. I think you'll find it useful.

    A: I had a big problem at the office today!
    B: What happened?
    A: I could not use my computer all day!
    B: Was it because of a virus?
    A: Yes, I opened a file that had a virus
    B: Oh no! You must be careful when you open files in your email. A virus can make your whole computer crash.

    A: It was an accident! I didn't know the file had a virus. I'll be more careful next time.
    B: What did you do next?
    A: I asked a computer repairman to come to the office. He worked all day to repair my computer. But the real problem is that I may have lost some of my work.
    B: Don't worry. Your work is probably still on your computer. I can help you get it back. Next time, make sure you have backup files. Just in case it happens again.

    M: I'm thinking about buying a big screen TV.
    W: Wow! I've seen those in the store. They cost a lot of money. Can you afford to buy one?
    M: They do cost a lot of money. But I really enjoy watching TV. I think it's much more fun to watch TV shows on a big screen.
    W: I've never watched TV on a big screen.

    W: I've never watched TV on a big screen. Do you think the quality of the picture is good?
    M: Yes, the quality is great. When you watch soccer games, you feel like you are right there on the field.
    W: When you buy the TV, can I come over to your house? Then, I can enjoy watching TV on the big screen with you!
    M: I have to save some money to buy the TV first. It will be a few months!

    M: I just bought a digital camera.
    W: What is wrong with your old camera?
    M: Nothing. I bought this one because I want to store my pictures on my computer.
    W: I see.
    M: I can also delete pictures that are not very good.
    W: I like to print all my photos. That's why I like the old cameras.
    M: Oh, you can print digital photos, too. Many shops will print them for you.
    W: Really?

    M: Yes. You can even buy a good printer and do it from home.
    W: That seems easy! How do you store these digital pictures?
    M: You can store the pictures on your computer. But you might run out of space.I save all the pictures I like on compact discs. You can store more than seven hundred photos on one CD!
    W: Great! Maybe I should get a digital camera, too.
