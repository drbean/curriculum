    W: I need to check my messages.
    M: How are going to do that? We are in the middle of the freeway!
    W: I'm going to use my cell phone. Haven't you ever done that?
    M: No. I just use my cell phone to talk to other people.
    W: Now you can also use a cell phone to send and receive short text messages. It's very useful.
    M: How do you send messages that way?
    W: I just use the keys on the phone to type a short message. Then I press the "send" button. It's cheaper than making a phone call.
    M: That's a great idea! You can save both time and money that way.
    W: Right. All my friends usually send me text messages now.
    M: Thanks for telling me about this. I'll have to try it!
    W: You're welcome. I think you'll find it useful.

    M: I had a big problem at the office today!
    W: What happened?
    M: I could not use my computer all day!
    W: Was it because of a virus?
    M: Yes, I opened a file that had a virus
    W: Oh no! You must be careful when you open files in your email. A virus can make your whole computer crash.
    M: It was an accident! I didn't know the file had a virus. I'll be more careful next time.
    W: What did you do next?
    M: I asked a computer repairman to come to the office. He worked all day to repair my computer. But the real problem is that I may have lost some of my work.
    W: Don't worry. Your work is probably still on your computer. I can help you get it back. Next time, make sure you have back-up files. Just in case it happens again.
