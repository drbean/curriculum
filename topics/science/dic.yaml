    W: I need to check my messages.
    M: How are going to do that? We are in the middle of the freeway!
    W: I'm going to use my cell phone. Haven't you ever done that?
    M: No. I just use my cell phone to talk to other people.
    W: Now you can also use a cell phone to send and receive short text messages. It's very useful.
    M: How do you send messages that way?
    W: I just use the keys on the phone to type a short message. Then I press the "send" button. It's cheaper than making a phone call.
    M: That's a great idea! You can save both time and money that way.
    W: Right. All my friends usually send me text messages now.
    M: Thanks for telling me about this. I'll have to try it!
    W: You're welcome. I think you'll find it useful.

    Where do the bubbles come from when you boil water?
    Water is a liquid. When it is heated, it moves around faster and faster. When it starts to boil, the liquid turns into a gas. This gas is called water vapor. This gas is lighter than the water around it. It rises to the top. Then it disappears into the air.
    As the water gets hotter and hotter, it starts turning into a gas very quickly. A lot of bubbles form at the same time. All these bubbles try to escape at once. The bubbles push the water out of the way and "jump" out. This is what we call "boiling water."
    More and more water turns into a gas. More of it disappears into the air. After a while, every drop of the water will be gone.

    B: Joe asked me something about science just now. But I didn't know the answer.
    G: I'm good at science. Ask me.
    B: OK. Why is the sky blue?
    G: I'll explain it in a simple way. Light comes through the air from the sun in waves.
    B: The light is in many colors, right?
    G: Right. Blue waves are smaller than air molecules. They sometimes get absorbed by these molecules.

    B: OK. What happens then?
    G: Then the blue light waves scatter in many directions. Your eyes see this blue light from above you, after it leaves the air molecules.
    B: So that is what makes the sky blue! What happens to the other colors?
    G: They reflect off the things that they hit. Your shirt is red because our eyes see the red light reflected from it.
    B: Now I understand why the sky is blue!

    M: Nothing. I bought this one because I want to store my pictures on my computer.
    W: I see.
    M: I can also delete pictures that are not very good.
    W: I like to print all my photos. That's why I like the old cameras.
    M: Oh, you can print digital photos, too. Many shops will print them for you.
    W: Really?
    M: Yes. You can even buy a good printer and do it from home.
    W: That seems easy! How do you store these digital pictures?
    M: You can store the pictures on your computer. But you might run out of space.I save all the pictures I like on compact discs. You can store more than seven hundred photos on one CD!
    W: Great! Maybe I should get a digital camera, too.

    W: You know, I think you might want to go to the library and look at some books.
    B: I don't want to. It takes too much time, and besides, this is fast, easy and fun. This paper will be done in no time.

    W: But it is also full of misinformation and lies. You don't really know what you are looking at unless you are at a reliable site. It's safer to get some books first and then search for more information.
    B: Grandma, I love you, but I think you are a little old-fashioned. Look at all this great information!  My report is on Albert Einstein. Now, according to this site, he was born in 1979, came up with the theory of relatives, and was awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1922.

    W: Your information is wrong. Albert Einstein was born in 1879 and developed the theory of general relativity. He won the Nobel Prize in 1921.
    B: Wow! This means all this stuff is inaccurate. How did you know all that?
    W: Come with me to the library and I'll help you find the books with those facts.
    B: Thank you, Grandma. You're a real life-saver!

    M: Did you have a certain model in mind, ma'am?
    W: I'm not thinking of any specific model. I want something simple for basic math.
    M: Is it for personal use?
    W: Yes. I just need it for shopping and keeping track of my bills.
    M: Well, the great thing is that these simple calculators are very inexpensive and small. Her is a solar model that never needs batteries. It is thin, too.

    I have been interested in robots for as long as I can remember. The first thing I did when I entered high school was join the Robotech robot-making club. We get together after school every day and create our own robots. Nowadays it is very easy to find kits to build your own robot and these are what we use.
    The highlight of the year for us is the annual Robot Maze race. Everyone who wants to take part has to make a small computer-controlled robot. You need to race it to the center of a maze.

    We work together in teams of three or four. This year, I am working with two students who won last year's competition, so I think we have a really good chance of winning. Our robot is about 30 centimeters high. It weighs two kilograms. It should be really quick. We have been practicing often, and we have already equaled last year's speed, so we just need to get a little faster. We are keeping the design of our robot secret. If we win, we will get \$500. I hope this will be my lucky year.

    M: You don't need to be an airplane pilot to use a flying car. The article says there would be a computer inside the car that would know where you want to go.
    M: The driver does not need to control the car unless something goes wrong.
    W: Does the article say how much a flying car would cost? It will probably cost too much money! We would not be able to afford one.
    M: True, but wouldn't it be nice to fly over traffic jams, instead of sitting in the middle of them?
    W: Yes, but then we might end up with traffic jams in the sky.

    Albert Einstein is famous around the world. He is famous for his work in science. Many people think that he was the greatest scientist of the 20th century.
    Einstein was born in Germany in 1879. His interest in science began when he was very young. Someone gave him a compass in 1884.

    Young Einstein was interested in how it worked. He wanted to learn science. He wanted to become a scientist.
    Einstein tried to enter a top Swiss university. At first, he met with failure. He did not get a place. But Einstein did not give up easily. He applied again to the same university in the next year. This time he was successful. Einstein was a good student. He graduated from this famous university in 1896.
    As a scientist, Einstein did important work in the field of physics. His work was very good. He received the Nobel Prize for physics in 1921. In 1933, he went to live in the United States with his wife.

    B: Which planet is closest to Earth?
    G: Mars is the closest planet to Earth. Many scientists believe that Mars once had rivers and oceans just like Earth. Mars has two moons.
    B: That's cool. What is the other planet near Earth?
    G: The other planet near Earth is Venus, but Venus has no moons.
    B: Do you think people will ever be able to visit Mars or Venus?
