    Friends are an important part of our lives. They help us in many ways. Do you tell your friends that you are glad they are your friends? Everyone should tell their friends that they are special.
    Did you know that there is now a special day just for friends? This day is called International Friendship Day. The first Sunday in August was chosen to be National Friendship Day in 1935. This holiday is not as big as Christmas or New Year's Day. However, it is still a special day.
    People are usually too busy to visit their friends often. But this day is different.

    There are more than 6 billion human beings in the world. Each one is different from all the others. No two people look exactly alike. People from one country may look the same in general. But they are not totally alike.
    Most people in Vietnam have straight black hair and black eyes. But they all look different. People in America have straight hair, curly hair, or wavy hair. Their hair may be black, brown, yellow, or red. Some people have brown or gray eyes. Some have blue or green eyes. Even people in the same family look different from each other!
    We all think differently. We all like different things. We like different kinds of food and different kinds of music.

    We also like different styles of clothing.
    Wherever you are, you are different from everyone else. Nobody else looks just like you. Nobody has your thoughts or your talents. There are more than six billion people on Earth, but none of them are exactly like you. You are one of a kind.
