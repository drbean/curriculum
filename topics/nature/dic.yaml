    There are many forests in North America. There are many trees in these forests. Some of these trees are more than two hundred feet tall. Some are over five hundred years old.
    Several kinds of trees grow in these forests. Fir, cedar and pine are three. These trees grow in different areas. Some grow in forests. Some grow on mountains. People who lived in this place long ago used these trees to make things out of wood.
    Many of these trees are now in special areas. These areas are called forest reserves or national parks.
    Some parks charge a small entrance fee. Visitors must pay the entrance fee to enter the parks. Then they can walk among the beautiful old trees. They must take care not to damage the trees. We should all take care of forests.

    Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice. 250 million years ago, it was farther north, warm, and had forests and dinosaurs. Now, the continent has 70 percent of the world's water. But, although it is very windy, there is very little snow. It is the world's coldest, driest, windiest continent.
    The only large animals which live there are penguins and seals. No-one calls it home, but 4000 scientists go there in summer.

    Antarctica is another name for the South Pole. It is also a continent. A long time ago, the South Pole was close to the equator. That was 500 million years ago. It was once joined to Australia. Then, all the land on Earth started to move. Antarctica moved away from Australia and went south. 
    Dinosaur bones were once found at the South Pole. Do you know why? Dinosaurs lived there millions of years ago. This was before it moved away from the equator.
    About 98\% of this continent is frozen. The rest is made up of rock. The South Pole has 87\% of the world's ice. But did you know that it gets very little snow? Only about two inches of snow falls each year.
    How many people live on your continent? No lives in the South Pole. Ony animals, like penguins, live there. Scientists and tourists visit there, but they don't stay long. Do you want to visit Antarctica? It is the coldest, driest place on Earth.

    Turtles are in danger of becoming extinct. Sea turtles lay their eggs in big nests they dig in the sand on the beach. After 2 months, the baby turtles climb out of the nest and crawl down the beach to the sea. But of the hundred or more eggs in the next, only one baby turtle will survive until it becomes an adult.
    Turtle eggs look like a soft ping-pong ball, and don't taste good, but people eat them. This may be illegal, but the laws are often broken.

    Goodall is the only person who has been an accepted member of a group of chimpanzees. She was the lowest-ranked "chimpanzee" for 22 months in a group in an African rain forest. She found that chimpanzees make tools, tearing leaves off a twig which they would push into a hole in a tree and then pull out. The twig would be covered with white ants, which they would eat. She also found that chimpanzees will kill other monkeys and then eat them. They even have wars.

    G: Hello, Mrs. Wilson. How are you?
    W: I'm worried, Brianna. Thousands of ants are all over my patio!
    G: That's quite a problem.
    W: What's worse is that my daughter's birthday party is in a few days and I wanted to have it one the patio.
    G: Why don't you call an exterminator?
    W: I would but I don't want all those hazardous chemicals around my children. It's harmful and unhealthy. I also don't want dangerous substances to seep into the garden.
    G: I usually don't have problems with ants, and I don't use any chemicals.
    W: What's your secret?
    G: Well, ants are difficult to control, so I planted a lot of mint plants near my deck. I also use cinnamon and cayenne pepper. I just sprinkle them around the places I don't want ants. Some people have tried it and said it worked. Others said they needed to try something else.
    W: I think it's worth a try. I would rather use cinnamon and mint around my patio than some hazardous chemicals. Besides, I don't mind having the ants in the yard. I simply don't want them coming to the birthday party. Would you mind helping me?
    G: It would be a pleasure. I have a lot of cinnamon at home and I can run to the store to get the plants for you.
    W: Thank you, Brianna. You're such a thoughtful person.

    G: We need the sun.
    It gives us light.
    We see it in the day.

    What is the sun?
    It is really a star.

    The sun looks big.
    But, it's not.

    The sun is a very small star.
    It is a very bright star, too.

    W: This is a good spot. Let's stop and have our picnic next to the river.
    M: Good idea. Walking always makes me hungry. I'm ready for lunch.
    W: We can sit here on the grass. Oh no! Someone forgot to throw these empty paper bags away. There is litter everywhere!
    M: Why do people always leave litter around? It's not a nice thing to do. It spoils other people's picnics.

    W: I think they're lazy. Or maybe they just don't care. Look, there are some empty cans and glass bottles under that tree, too.
    M: People should clean up before they leave, and not leave litter lying around.
    W: That's right. Well, after our picnic, let's pick up all the litter we can and take it out of here.
    M: OK! And next week, let's come back with friends and pick up some more.
    W: Good idea!

    M: Hi, Jane! Have you heard about the new laws to help people recycle?
    W: I heard about them on the news last night. I don't think I like them.
    M: The government wants to keep the environment clean by recycling paper, metal and glass instead of throwing these things away.
    W: But who wants to pay an extra 50 cents each time you buy a cup of coffee? That's a lot of money.

    M: 50 cents? It's only 5 cents extra for a paper cup.
    W: I thought it was 50 cents!
    M: No, it's only 50 cents. Don't worry. You can get your money back when you return the cup.
    W: That's fair. Well, maybe the government is right, after all. I'll return all the paper cups I use.
    M: We all need to recycle \& help keep the environment clean.
