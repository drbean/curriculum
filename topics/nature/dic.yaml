    There are many forests in North America. There are many trees in these forests. Some of these trees are more than two hundred feet tall. Some are over five hundred years old.
    Several kinds of trees grow in these forests. Fir, cedar and pine are three. These trees grow in different areas. Some grow in forests. Some grow on mountains. People who lived in this place long ago used these trees to make things out of wood.
    Many of these trees are now in special areas. These areas are called forest reserves or national parks.
    Some parks charge a small entrance fee. Visitors must pay the entrance fee to enter the parks. Then they can walk among the beautiful old trees. They must take care not to damage the trees. We should all take care of forests.

    Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice. 250 million years ago, it was farther north, warm, and had forests and dinosaurs. Now, the continent has 70 percent of the world's water. But, although it is very windy, there is very little snow. It is the world's coldest, driest, windiest continent.
    The only large animals which live there are penguins and seals. No-one calls it home, but 4000 scientists go there in summer.

    Turtles are in danger of becoming extinct. Sea turtles lay their eggs in big nests they dig in the sand on the beach. After 2 months, the baby turtles climb out of the nest and crawl down the beach to the sea. But of the hundred or more eggs in the next, only one baby turtle will survive until it becomes an adult.
    Turtle eggs look like a soft ping-pong ball, and don't taste good, but people eat them. This may be illegal, but the laws are often broken.
