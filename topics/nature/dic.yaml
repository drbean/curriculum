    There are many forests in North America. There are many trees in these forests. Some of these trees are more than two hundred feet tall. Some are over five hundred years old.
    Several kinds of trees grow in these forests. Fir, cedar and pine are three. These trees grow in different areas. Some grow in forests. Some grow on the mountains.

    People who lived in this place long ago used these trees to make things out of wood.
    Many of these trees are now in special areas. These areas are called forest reserves or national parks.Some parks charge a small entrance fee. Visitors must pay the entrance fee to enter the parks. Then they can walk among the beautiful old trees. They must take care not to damage the trees.

    Antarctica was not always cold, dry, and covered in ice. 250 million years ago, it was farther north, warm, and had forests and dinosaurs. Now, the continent has 70 percent of the world's water. But, although it is very windy, there is very little snow. It is the world's coldest, driest, windiest continent.
    The only large animals which live there are penguins and seals. No-one calls it home, but 4000 scientists go there in summer.

    Antarctica is another name for the South Pole. It is also a continent. A long time ago, the South Pole was close to the equator. That was 500 million years ago. It was once joined to Australia. Then, all the land on Earth started to move. Antarctica moved away from Australia and went south. 
    Dinosaur bones were once found at the South Pole. Do you know why? Dinosaurs lived there millions of years ago. This was before it moved away from the equator.
    About 98\% of this continent is frozen. The rest is made up of rock. The South Pole has 87\% of the world's ice. But did you know that it gets very little snow? Only about two inches of snow falls each year.
    How many people live on your continent? No lives in the South Pole. Ony animals, like penguins, live there. Scientists and tourists visit there, but they don't stay long. Do you want to visit Antarctica? It is the coldest, driest place on Earth.

    Antarctica is the fifth-largest continent. It is nearly twice the size of Australia. Almost all of Antarctica is covered by ice that averages 1.9 km in thickness.
    Antarctica is the coldest, driest, and windiest continent, and has the highest average height. Antarctica is a desert, with annual snowfall of only 200 mm along the coast and far less inland. The temperature in Antarctica has reached −89.2 °C, though the average for the coldest part of the year is −63 °C.
    From 1,000 to 5,000 people live there throughout the year at research stations across the continent. There are a surprising number of micro-organisms, very small animals and penguins and seals.

    Antarctica was first seen from ships in 1820. The first person went on land there in 1895, but for thousands of years people had believed land existed there. The first persons reached the South Pole in 1911. The South Pole was not reached again until 1956 when a US Navy group landed a plane there.

    W: No. What is the story?
    M: Turtles are in danger of becoming extinct around the world. Every year, thousands of turtles lay eggs on the beach. After the turtles lay their eggs in the sand, people come along and take them.
    W: I suppose the people like eating turtle eggs.

    W: Is there anything we can do to help?
    M: I'm going to call the Environmental Protection hotline. They might have some information about the project to help save turtles in Mexico.
    W: They might even have a brochure. Let's find the website on my computer. Oh, here it is. The address is www.enviro.com. There's plenty of information here.

    Turtles are in danger of becoming extinct. Sea turtles lay their eggs in big nests they dig in the sand on the beach. After 2 months, the baby turtles climb out of the nest and crawl down the beach to the sea. But of the hundred or more eggs in the next, only one baby turtle will survive until it becomes an adult.
    Turtle eggs look like a soft ping-pong ball, and don't taste good, but people eat them. This may be illegal, but the laws are often broken.

    Goodall is the only person who has been an accepted member of a group of chimpanzees. She was the lowest-ranked "chimpanzee" for 22 months in a group in an African rain forest. She found that chimpanzees make tools, tearing leaves off a twig which they would push into a hole in a tree and then pull out. The twig would be covered with white ants, which they would eat. She also found that chimpanzees will kill other monkeys and then eat them. They even have wars.

    Jane Goodall went to Africa when she was 26 years old. She went there to research chimpanzees. At that time, no other women scientists worked there alone.
    At first, Jane studied the chimps from far away. The chimps were afraid of her. They ran away if she came close to them. After some time, the chimps saw that she was not going to hurt them.

    They let her walk near them. Soon, she was living among them. She wanted to learn more and more about them. Jane did a lot of research on chimps. She discovered many things about them. She learned that each chimp has its own personality. She saw that they have feelings.
    Jane discovered that chimps have very close families. Mothers and fathers take good care of baby chimps. An adult female chimp will sometimes adopt an orphan.
    In 1977, Jane started an institute to help protect animals. She wanted to help animals all around the world. Today, this institute runs programs in over 70 countries.

    G: Hello, Mrs. Wilson. How are you?
    W: I'm worried, Brianna. Thousands of ants are all over my patio!
    G: That's quite a problem.
    W: What's worse is that my daughter's birthday party is in a few days and I wanted to have it one the patio.
    G: Why don't you call an exterminator?
    W: I would but I don't want all those hazardous chemicals around my children. It's harmful and unhealthy. I also don't want dangerous substances to seep into the garden.
    G: I usually don't have problems with ants, and I don't use any chemicals.
    W: What's your secret?
    G: Well, ants are difficult to control, so I planted a lot of mint plants near my deck. I also use cinnamon and cayenne pepper. I just sprinkle them around the places I don't want ants. Some people have tried it and said it worked. Others said they needed to try something else.
    W: I think it's worth a try. I would rather use cinnamon and mint around my patio than some hazardous chemicals. Besides, I don't mind having the ants in the yard. I simply don't want them coming to the birthday party. Would you mind helping me?
    G: It would be a pleasure. I have a lot of cinnamon at home and I can run to the store to get the plants for you.
    W: Thank you, Brianna. You're such a thoughtful person.
