    A caster board is a skateboard in which the front end and back end are joined by a bar. The board has only 2 inline wheels, like inline skates. The rider moves forward by twisting the board. This works the same way inline skaters move their feet to go forward.
    The boards are banned in a Japanese skatepark. When riders fall off, the board can go in different directions. This is a danger for other skateboarders.
    But in UK schools, students use them in PE classes.

    M: Stay low and bend your knees. Come over here.
    B: Yes, Coach?
    M: Jackson, when you're playing defense, keep your knees bent and your body low. It helps you keep your balance. And it allows you to move more quickly in every direction.
    B: Like this?
    M: That's right. You should attempt to stay on the balls of your feet. It's like you are getting ready to pounce. Athletes never rest on their heels.
    B: Should I stand with my legs close together or far apart?

    M: It is best to keep them about shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees and keep your back straight. Spread your arms straight out at your sides.
    B: This seems almost like I'm getting ready to attack the ball.
    M: It is a little bit like that. Your stance looks much better than before.
    B: Coach, how do I move forward and backward on defense. I feel like my stance is fine, but when I dart toward my opponent, I keep tripping over my feet.

    B: I feel like my stance is fine, but when I dart toward my opponent, I keep tripping over my feet.
    M: When you move forward, put your right foot in front of you, with your toes pointing in the direction you want to go. When you move backward, just reverse it: follow the direction of your left foot. How are you feeling?
    B: My legs are tired and my back aches.
    M: Playing defense is hard work. Take 5, then we'll try it again.

    B: I tried to run a marathon once. It was really difficult. I just can't run like my friend can.
    A: Yes, running a marathon is not an easy thing to do. By the way, how did your friend do in the race?

    W: You won't believe this, but I have some great news! I've got two tickets to the baseball game next Saturday.
    M: Did I hear you correctly? You have two tickets to the baseball game? How did you get those? I thought it was impossible to get tickets because they were all sold out last month!
    W: It was easy, actually. My colleague and her husband have to go to London that week, so they'll miss the game. They offered me their tickets, and of course I was happy to accept.
    M: You're so lucky! Who are you going to take with you?

    M: Don't do that. I would love to watch the game with you.

    M: Well, the game starts at nine o'clock in the morning, right?
    W: Yes, shall we meet here at 8:30 a.m. on Saturday?

    B: I went inline skating with my friends at the park.

    B: What about you? What did you do during the weekend?
    G: Actually, I also went inline skating. I go every weekend with my father. We usually skate about 20 kilometers each time.
    B: Wow! How can you skate so far? Your muscles must be really strong.
    G: I've been skating for three years now. You could skate that far, too. You just need to build up your muscles. Let's go skating together next weekend.
