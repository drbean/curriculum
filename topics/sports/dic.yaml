    Racquetball is a popular sport. It was first played in the US. This game started just a little more than 50 years ago. That makes it quite a new sport.
    Other racket sports like tennis and squash have been played for a long time. Racquetball rules are a mix of rules from both handball and squash. A short racket is used to play this game.
    This game became popular almost at once when it first came out. More and more people wanted to play it. Clubs began to build racquetball courts. They built these courts for players of this new sport.
    People of all ages can play this game. But most players today are young, between the ages of 12 and 34. Racquetball is now a famous sport. it is played all over the world.

    A caster board is a skateboard in which the front end and back end are joined by a bar. The board has only 2 inline wheels, like inline skates. The rider moves forward by twisting the board. This works the same way inline skaters move their feet to go forward.
    The boards are banned in a Japanese skatepark. When riders fall off, the board can go in different directions. This is a danger for other skateboarders.
    But in UK schools, students use them in PE classes.

    M: Stay low and bend your knees. Come over here.
    B: Yes, Coach?
    M: Jackson, when you're playing defense, keep your knees bent and your body low. It helps you keep your balance. And it allows you to move more quickly in every direction.
    B: Like this?
    M: That's right. You should attempt to stay on the balls of your feet. It's like you are getting ready to pounce. Athletes never rest on their heels.
    B: Should I stand with my legs close together or far apart?

    M: It is best to keep them about shoulder-width apart. Bend your knees and keep your back straight. Spread your arms straight out at your sides.
    B: This seems almost like I'm getting ready to attack the ball.
    M: It is a little bit like that. Your stance looks much better than before.
    B: Coach, how do I move forward and backward on defense. I feel like my stance is fine, but when I dart toward my opponent, I keep tripping over my feet.

    B: I feel like my stance is fine, but when I dart toward my opponent, I keep tripping over my feet.
    M: When you move forward, put your right foot in front of you, with your toes pointing in the direction you want to go. When you move backward, just reverse it: follow the direction of your left foot. How are you feeling?
    B: My legs are tired and my back aches.
    M: Playing defense is hard work. Take 5, then we'll try it again.

    He saw the whole race, from start to finish. Perhaps he watched it on TV. Or perhaps he followed the runners around as they ran. The woman says he is so lucky.
