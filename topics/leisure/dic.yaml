    M: I love this amusement park, Fran! Thanks for suggesting it. I am having a fantastic time. There's that new ride! It's called, the Volcano, and it's supposed to be amazing.
    W: That looks awfully high. Do you really want to try it? We've experienced the Rocket, the giant ferris wheel and those bumper boats. Don't you think that is enough? Besides, I'm absolutely starving.
    M: If you come on the Volcano with me, I'll buy you a pizza with whatever toppings you want.
    W: Do you really mean any topping, even mushrooms, which you don't like?
    M: Yes, I will even order a pizza with mushrooms!
    W: OK, Michael. I will try this last ride.

    M: Great, Fran! I know you will enjoy this. Did you know that when the volcano erupts, our seats shake? I heard it is quite an experience.
    W: I am not sure that I want to get on this ride anymore.
    M: Don't worry, Fran. Look at the people getting off the ride. They look very..
    W: I'm sorry, but I don't think I can do this, even for pizza. How would you feel if I bought lunch instead?
    M: I don't really want to force you to do something you really don't want to do.

    The lates blockbuster movie, Robots Attack 2, starring Harrison Ford opened yesterday. Ford and Andy Robot are at it again, saving people from the jaws of death. the evil robots are invading Atlantis once again. The crowds seemed to love the sequel. Maybe they loved it as much, if not more than, the first Robots Attack. The special effects are fantastic. Mr. Ford seems to have worked on his fighting technique. His martial skills are amazing. He beats the evil robots easily.

    W: Did you watch the latest episode of that new reality show last night?
    M: There are so many reality shows these days. Which one are you talking about?
    W: It's called "Good Fences" and it's all about neighbors. This reality show is the only one I watch, because you're right, the others are just silly.

    M: I never watch reality shows at all. I prefer to watch shows that teach me about something, like science and nature programs, and travel shows.
    W: Oh, I like travel shows, too. My favorite travel show is the one with that chef from England. He travels, cooks and eats all the time!
    M: I like that one too. He really makes me laugh. He has a good senses of humor.
    W: Let's watch it together this week. It's on Thursday at eight o'clock, right?
    M: That's right, but where shall we watch it?
    W: Well, I have a big\_screen TV and a comfortable sofa.
    M: OK, we'll watch it at your place then, and I'll brinkg some snacks. See you then!
