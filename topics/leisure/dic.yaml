    M: I love this amusement park, Fran! Thanks for suggesting it. I am having a fantastic time. There's that new ride! It's called, the Volcano, and it's supposed to be amazing.
    W: That looks awfully high. Do you really want to try it? We've experienced the Rocket, the giant ferris wheel and those bumper boats. Don't you think that is enough? Besides, I'm absolutely starving.
    M: If you come on the Volcano with me, I'll buy you a pizza with whatever toppings you want.

    W: Do you really mean any topping, even mushrooms, which you don't like?
    M: Yes, I will even order a pizza with mushrooms!
    W: OK, Michael. I will try this last ride.
    M: Great, Fran! I know you will enjoy this. Did you know that when the volcano erupts, our seats shake? I heard it is quite an experience.
    W: I am not sure that I want to get on this ride anymore.
    M: Don't worry, Fran. Look at the people getting off the ride. They look very satisfied.
    W: I'm sorry, but I don't think I can do this, even for pizza. How would you feel if I bought lunch instead?
    M: I don't really want to force you to do something you really don't want to do. And I am hungry. Sure, let's get some lunch.
    W: I want to try this new restaurant called Skylight. The top of the restaurant spins while you eat!
    M: Oh, wow! Let's go!
