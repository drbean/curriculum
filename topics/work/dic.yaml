    B: Hello Wendy! Who did you do your assignment about?
    G: I wrote about my dad. He is a firefighter.
    B: Really? Does he go into burning buildings?
    G: Yes. He sometimes has to crawl into tight spaces to rescue people.
    B: Has he ever been trapped in a burning building?
    G: One time he broke down a door to carry a girl out of a house.

    B: Your dad is incredibly brave, a real hero. What does he do at the fire station?
    G: He resides there for a few days when he works. All of the firefighters cook, eat and clean together. When there's a fire, they slide down a pole into the fire station's garage to get their fire-fighting equipment. They quickly put on their gear and then jump onto the fire trucks. My dad loves to drive the fire trucks.
    B: Wow! Maybe I should be a firefighter someday.

    G: Well, one time he needed to break down a door. He was carrying a little girl out of her house. Someone left the stove on, and it ignited a fire in the kitchen.
    G: All five people living there escaped safely, but the house burned to the ground.

    G: If we set up in an area with a lot of traffic on a hot day, we will get plenty of customers. We can charge a dollar-50 per cup.
    B: That's too much.
    G: But we need to charge that much to cover our expenses. By charging a dollar-50, we can make good money.
    B: OK. What do we need to get started?
    G: We need the ingredients to make lemonade, so we need lemons, sugar and water. We need something to keep our money in, a sign to advertise the lemonade, paper cups, and a cardboard box..

    G: We need a sign to advertise, paper cups, and a cardboard box to use as a stand.
    B: Should we sell food to go with the lemonade?
    G: I think that would be too complicated. We would need a permit and either a cooler or a stove. We should stick to just selling lemonade.
    B: You're right. Let's just keep it simple.
    G: OK, let's get set up and think of a plan to get some customers and make some sales!
    B: Why don't I attract the customers and you serve the lemonade?
    G: Sounds good to me.

    A: You know, Kim. I think our new boss doesn't like me. I don't understand why.
    B: That's not true, Trevor! Why, just this morning I heard her say you're a very good employee. She said you work very hard every day.
    A: That's news to me. I wish she would say it to me, but she just criticizes everything I do.
    B: I think you're being too sensitive.
    A: Do you really think so? Maybe I just need a vacation. I haven't had one for years.

    A: I didn't realize that. Now that I think about it, you're right. I feel much better.
