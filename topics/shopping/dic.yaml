    Ryan is busy today. He goes to the mall to buy a gift for his friend. It is his friend's birthday.

    He is going to buy him a baseball bat. But, he doesn't have enough money for it. He goes to the bakery. He'll just buy his friend a cake.

    But, he still doesn't have enough money. So, he just sends him a nice card.
