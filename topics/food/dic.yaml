    Sam is making dinner.  He's making a salad.
    First, he cuts two tomatoes. Then, he cuts two cucumbers. Next, he cuts two carrots. He puts them into a bowl. He pours the salad dressing on. Now, it's ready.
    But, wait. Something isn't right. What is it? Oh, no! Sam forgot the lettuce.

    B: Oh, good. You're home. Did you get carrots and onions at the store?
    G: Yes, but I didn't get tomatoes. They didn't have any.
    B: That's OK. What about the lettuce?
    G: Oh, no! I forgot it!
    B: No lettuce? Well, we can't make a salad now.
    G: Let's make something else for dinner.

    Many farmers grew big carrots. But, they didn't use most of them.
    Some carrots started to rot. So, people didn't want to eat them or buy them.
    Then, one farmer had an idea. He cut the carrots into small pieces. He took the bad pieces out, and he kept the good pieces.
    He made baby carrots.

    M: Last month I had a checkup. My doctor told me that I should be leading a much healthier lifestyle now that I'm getting older.
