    Sam is making dinner.  He's making a salad.
    First, he cuts two tomatoes. Then, he cuts two cucumbers. Next, he cuts two carrots. He puts them into a bowl. He pours the salad dressing on. Now, it's ready.
    But, wait. Something isn't right. What is it? Oh, no! Sam forgot the lettuce.

    Many farmers grew big carrots. But, they didn't use most of them.
    Some carrots started to rot. So, people didn't want to eat them or buy them.
    Then, one farmer had an idea. He cut the carrots into small pieces. He took the bad pieces out, and he kept the good pieces.
    He made baby carrots.

    W: I have lost seven pounds in one week! Skipping breakfast really works.
    M: I don't think that's a good idea.
    W: Why not?
    M: People who skip breakfast eat more at the next meal. Eating breakfast is very important. Breakfast gives you energy for the day.
    W: Well, I eat one big meal at dinnertime.
    M: Having one meal a day is not good. You should have several small meals a day. You'll have more energy that way.
    W: Maybe you're right. I have been feeling really tired lately.
    M: What do you usually eat?
    W: I only eat salads now.
    M: Salads alone my not be nutritious enough.
    W: So, what should I eat?
