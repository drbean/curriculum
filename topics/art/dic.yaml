    What makes a painting a great work of art? There are many answers to that question. Some people think a painting should look pretty. Others disagree. The skill of the painter is important. The techniques used are also important. Most of all a great painting has meaning. A great painting has a special element in it.

    Sometimes, a painter's special element is the way he portrays his or her feelings in a piece of art.

    An example of this is Picasso's painting, Guernica. It has strange shapes in it. It shows suffering people, too. It is not a very pretty picture. However, it makes people understand Picasso's feelings about war.

    Other times, the element is a memory or feeling. This comes from inside another person. Someone may see a painting and be reminded of a beautiful memory. A painting can also remind people of a feeling.

    For example, Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa is very popular. Many people like her smile. Some people say it is a mysterious smile. Others say it is a happy one. Still others make up stories about the woman in the painting.

    Which element is the most important? Is it the skill of the artist or the feelings of the person looking at the painting? Whatever the case, a painting that grabs people's emotions is popular.

    G: What are you looking at, Billy?
    B: This is a copy of my favorite painting. It's the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci.
    G: Why is that your favorite painting?
    B: Well, there are a few things that make the Mona Lisa great. First, she has no eyebrows. Second, she has a really beautiful smile. Most of all, I like the soft colors of the painting. Have you seen the Mona Lisa?

    G: Of course! I've seen the painting a few times before. But I never noticed that her eyebrows are missing. I wonder why she has no eyebrows. Do you know why?
    B: At the time da Vinci painted it, it was fashionable for young Italian girls to shave off their eyebrows. Every girl wanted to be fashionable.
    G: Wow! That's really interesting. In what year was the Mona Lisa painted?
    B: I think it was painted some time between 1503 and 1505.

    B: Barrel drums? What are those?
    M: They are made with hollow logs and animal skins. First, they cut down a tree. They cut a section that's about as thick and tall as a barrel. They stretch an animal skin over the top, and tie it to the sides with wooden pegs. These pegs can be tightened to change the pitch.
    M: In Nigeria, they have "talking" drums. They use a hollow trunk that's smaller than a barrel drum, and leave an opening at both ends. Then they fit an animal skin...

    M: .. on each end. There's a string between each of these ends. When a player holds the drum under an armpit and squeezes it, it tightens the string and raises the pitch.
    B: Why do they call it a "talking" drum?B: Hmm.. That sounds interesting.
    M: The drummers are so skillful they can make the drums imitate human voices. They seem to cry, laugh and shout.

    W: Why didn't you say something? No wonder your playing sounded so bad. Oh dear, I'm sorry.
    M: It was a very bad performance, I agree. I was miserable and unhappy, but I had to perform anyway.
    W: Have you been seeing anyone else since you two broke up?
    M: No, I have been working overtime instead. The conductor was not pleased with my last performance. Besides, don't you think it's too soon?
    W: Not at all. You might just need to get out and socialize. Hey, I've got a fabulous idea!

    W: Do you remember me telling you about Julia, a friend of mine?
    M: I think so. Why?
    W: Wel, she is single. How about meeting her?
    M: A blind date? I tried that once, and it was a disaster.
    W: Come on, Mike. You will have a great time together. She is charming, and she also plays the oboe. You can go to the concert in the park on Saturday afternoon. Maybe you can have coffee afterwards.
