    What makes a painting a great work of art? There are many answers to that question. Some people think a painting should look pretty. Others disagree. The skill of the painter is important. The techniques used are also important. Most of all a great painting has meaning. A great painting has a special element in it.

    Sometimes, a painter's special element is the way he portrays his or her feelings in a piece of art.

    An example of this is Picasso's painting, Guernica. It has strange shapes in it. It shows suffering people, too. It is not a very pretty picture. However, it makes people understand Picasso's feelings about war.

    Other times, the element is a memory or feeling. This comes from inside another person. Someone may see a painting and be reminded of a beautiful memory. A painting can also remind people of a feeling.

    For example, Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa is very popular. Many people like her smile. Some people say it is a mysterious smile. Others say it is a happy one. Still others make up stories about the woman in the painting.

    Which element is the most important? Is it the skill of the artist or the feelings of the person looking at the painting? Whatever the case, a painting that grabs people's emotions is popular.

    G: What are you looking at, Billy?
    B: This is a copy of my favorite painting. It's the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci.
    G: Why is that your favorite painting?
    B: Well, there are a few things that make the Mona Lisa great. First, she has no eyebrows. Second, she has a really beautiful smile. Most of all, I like the soft colors of the painting. Have you seen the Mona Lisa?

    G: Of course! I've seen the painting a few times before. But I never noticed that her eyebrows are missing. I wonder why she has no eyebrows. Do you know why?
    B: At the time da Vinci painted it, it was fashionable for young Italian girls to shave off their eyebrows. Every girl wanted to be fashionable.
    G: Wow! That's really interesting. In what year was the Mona Lisa painted?
    B: I think it was painted some time between 1503 and 1505.

    B: Barrel drums? What are those?
    M: They are made with hollow logs and animal skins. First, they cut down a tree. They cut a section that's about as thick and tall as a barrel. They stretch an animal skin over the top, and tie it to the sides with wooden pegs. These pegs can be tightened to change the pitch.
    M: In Nigeria, they have "talking" drums. They use a hollow trunk that's smaller than a barrel drum, and leave an opening at both ends. Then they fit an animal skin...

    Comic book heroes have been popular for many years. One hero has the strength of one hundred men. This hero also has the speed of lightning. This hero cannot be killed. If you think this hero is Superman, you are wrong! This hero is Wonder Woman!
    A man called William Marston created Wonder Woman in 1941. He was a graduate of Harvard University. He used a false name on his comics. He did not want his colleagues to know that he wrote comics. The false name was Charles Moulton.
    Mr Marston wanted to make a strong female hero for little girls. Of course, he hoped that little boys would like Wonder Woman, too.
