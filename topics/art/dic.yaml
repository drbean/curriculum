    Gold has been part of many cultures for hundreds of years. People made coins and jewelry with gold.
    Gold is a soft metal. It is easy to shape into sheets, long wires or rings. People sometimes mix gold with other metals. This makes the gold harder. Then it can be made into beautiful jewelry.
    Why do we value gold so much?

    It has a special color. No other metal is a bright yellow. We also value gold because it is rare. A rare thing is hard to find. Even after hundreds of years, gold is still a precious metal now. It is still valued for its beauty. It is still rare.
    Today, banks store gold in the form of bars. Its value is more than \$600 per ounce. Gold is more useful now than ever before.

    What makes a painting a great work of art? There are many answers to that question. Some people think a painting should look pretty. Others disagree. The skill of the painter is important. The techniques used are also important. Most of all a great painting has meaning. A great painting has a special element in it.

    Sometimes, a painter's special element is the way he portrays his or her feelings in a piece of art.

    An example of this is Picasso's painting, Guernica. It has strange shapes in it. It shows suffering people, too. It is not a very pretty picture. However, it makes people understand Picasso's feelings about war.

    Other times, the element is a memory or feeling. This comes from inside another person. Someone may see a painting and be reminded of a beautiful memory. A painting can also remind people of a feeling.

    For example, Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa is very popular. Many people like her smile. Some people say it is a mysterious smile. Others say it is a happy one. Still others make up stories about the woman in the painting.

    Which element is the most important? Is it the skill of the artist or the feelings of the person looking at the painting? Whatever the case, a painting that grabs people's emotions is popular.

    B: Barrel drums? What are those?
    M: They are made with hollow logs and animal skins. First, they cut down a tree. They cut a section that's about as thick and tall as a barrel. They stretch an animal skin over the top, and tie it to the sides with wooden pegs. These pegs can be tightened to change the pitch.
    M: In Nigeria, they have "talking" drums. They use a hollow trunk that's smaller than a barrel drum, and leave an opening at both ends. Then they fit an animal skin...

    M: .. on each end. There's a string between each of these ends. When a player holds the drum under an armpit and squeezes it, it tightens the string and raises the pitch.
    B: Why do they call it a "talking" drum?B: Hmm.. That sounds interesting.
    M: The drummers are so skillful they can make the drums imitate human voices. They seem to cry, laugh and shout.
    M: Why don't you come to the community college with me tomorrow? A troupe from Africa is giving a concert, ...

    W: Why didn't you say something? No wonder your playing sounded so bad. Oh dear, I'm sorry.
    M: It was a very bad performance, I agree. I was miserable and unhappy, but I had to perform anyway.
    W: Have you been seeing anyone else since you two broke up?
    M: No, I have been working overtime instead. The conductor was not pleased with my last performance. Besides, don't you think it's too soon?
    W: Not at all. You might just need to get out and socialize. Hey, I've got a fabulous idea!

    M: Oh no, not another one of your ideas. What is it this time?
    W: Do you remember me telling you about Julia, a friend of mine?
    M: I think so. Why?
    W: Wel, she is single. How about meeting her?
    M: A blind date? I tried that once, and it was a disaster.
    W: Come on, Mike. You will have a great time together. She is charming, and she also plays the oboe. You can go to the concert in the park on Saturday afternoon. Maybe you can have coffee afterwards.
