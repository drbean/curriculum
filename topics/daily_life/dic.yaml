    A: Andy! Welcome to Top of the Pops!
    B: Thanks, Tanya. It's great to be here in the US and using English.
    A: You're a famous singer, Andy. I want to ask you some questions.
    B: Of course. Ask me about what I like to do at home in Hong Kong.
    A: OK. But first, how old are you?
    B: I will be 25 years old next month. My birthday is in July.
    A: Do you come from Hong Kong? Do you live there all year round?
    B: Yes, I was born and have lived there my whole life. I love it.
    A: Now, you are on tour in the US. Do you like traveling, touring?
    B: Yes, but I prefer to be at home and perform in Hong Kong?
    A: Why is that? Is Hong Kong exciting? I haven't been there.
    B: Yes, and I have a nice view of the harbor from my apartment.
    A: What is your favorite thing to do when you are at home?
