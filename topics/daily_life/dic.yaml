    A: Do you come from Hong Kong? Do you live there all year round?
    B: Yes, I was born and have lived there my whole life. I love it.
    A: Now, you are on tour in the US. Do you like traveling, touring?

    There was once a man who lived with his two sons. The two sons were always fighting with each other. One day, the man decided to teach his sons a lesson.
    The man gave his younger son two large sticks. He told the boy to break them. The boy tried hard, but he could not break the sticks. The older son also could not break the sticks.

    At last the man gave only one stick to each son. He said, "Break them." Each son broke his stick easily.
    The man said, "You are like these sticks. If you work together, no one can break you. But if you fight with each other all the time, one day, someone will break both of you."
    After that lesson, the sons stopped fighting. They started to work together.

    When people work together as a team, they can achieve a lot. You can easily get things done when you share the work.
    We practice teamwork in my family. Both my parents have jobs. My father is a doctor. My mother is a teacher. Both of them work long hours all week. My brother is a student at college. I am a student in school. We all have very busy lives.

    So, when it comes to household chores, we all work together to get them done.
    Each of us has different chores. My parents take turn to cook. My father takes out the trash. My mother does the laundry. My brother washes the dishes. I sweep the floor. We share the chores and work together. Everything gets done fast.
    People should work as a team.
