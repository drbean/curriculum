    B: I finished my report on the French Revolution last night.
    G: How did you finish it so fast? I'm still trying to find books about it.
    B: There was something about the French Revolution on TV last week. I wrote down the names of all the people who were on the show.
    G: What did you do next?
    B: I went to the library and looked for their books. It was very easy, especially because I already understood what I wanted to say.

    B: I went to the library and looked for their books. It was very easy, especially because I already understood what I wanted to say.
    G: I guess I could have done that, but I missed the TV show. Why did Ms Dessard make us write about French history, anyway? She's a French language teacher, not a history teacher.
    B: Ms Dessard said that if we wanted to understand the language, we should understand the culture. I don't know if I speak better French, but I know more about French history now. If the French Revolution had never happened, French would be a very different language.
    G: You're right. I'm going to talk to Ms Dessard now. I'll see you later.

    B: I can't think of anything to write, and it's due tomorrow. To make matters worse, we have to perform an oral presentation in front of the entire class. I don't see the purpose of writing a book report, anyway.
    W: Writing is a necessary skill that you'll use for the rest of your life. This book report is just one way to begin learning that skill. It's another form of communication and a means of expressing your thoughts. It allows others to understand what is in your heart and mind.

    B: I've never had to write before. Why should I start now.
    W: Now is the best time to begin. The best writers read a lot, and practice writing. Anyone can learn to write well. I know you can do it.
    B: OK, Mom. When you put it that way, I think I can do it.
    W: That's the right attitude. Let's try to organize some of your thoughts by brainstorming. What can you tell me about the book?
    B: The book? I've only watched the movie!

    M: Psych sounds nice.
    W: How about we both sign up for psychology? Then we'd be in the same class, and we could help each other with assignments.
    M: I remember the last class we took together. I'm not so sure that's a good idea.

    W: I know someone who took the course last year, and she said it's very easy. Almost everyone gets an A or a B. And there is no homework.

    W: Do you ever wish that you had done something else?
    M: When I first started as a principal, I missed being a teacher. I liked spending time with children and helping them learn and grow. However, I knew that I could do a lot of good as a principal.
    W: You have certainly done a lot of good, Mr Shin! You started a special program to send all the students in yoru school to college!
    M: I had been planning to do that for some time. I'm glad the program is so successful.

    There are many kinds of schools for many kinds of students. One kind of school is the home school. Home schools are exactly that, schools at home.

    Parents choose to home school their child for many reasons. Some people feel that public schools are too dangerous. Some people think that the level of education is too low. Some parents do not approve of the subjects their children learn in public schools.

    If parents choose to home school their children, they must be ready to teach them well.

    There are many benefits to home schooling. Home schools are very small. There are just one or two students. The student's mother or father is the teacher. Another benefit is that students can study interesting things.

    Some people think that home schooling is not good for students. They believe public schools teach children discipline. They feel that public schools give a sense of community.

    In the end, parents must decide if home schooling is the right choice for their children.
