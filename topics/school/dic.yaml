    B: I finished my report on the French Revolution last night.
    G: How did you finish it so fast? I'm still trying to find books about it.
    B: There was something about the French Revolution on TV last week. I wrote down the names of all the people who were on the show.
    G: What did you do next?
    B: I went to the library and looked for their books. It was very easy, especially because I already understood what I wanted to say.

    G: I guess I could have done that, but I missed the TV show. Why did Ms Dessard make us write about French history, anyway? She's a French language teacher, not a history teacher.
    B: Ms Dessard said that if we wanted to understand the language, we should understand the culture. I don't know if I speak better French, but I know more about French history now. If the French Revolution had never happened, French would be a very different language.

    B: I can't think of anything to write, and it's due tomorrow. To make matters worse, we have to perform an oral presentation in front of the entire class. I don't see the purpose of writing a book report, anyway.
    W: Writing is a necessary skill that you'll use for the rest of your life. This book report is just one way to begin learning that skill. It's another form of communication and a means of expressing your thoughts. It allows others to understand what is in your heart and mind.

    B: I've never had to write before. Why should I start now.
    W: Now is the best time to begin. The best writers read a lot, and practice writing. Anyone can learn to write well. I know you can do it.
    B: OK, Mom. When you put it that way, I think I can do it.
    W: That's the right attitude. Let's try to organize some of your thoughts by brainstorming. What can you tell me about the book?
    B: The book? I've only watched the movie!
    W: Oh, dear! What kind of child am I raising?

    W: I heard that the psychology professor is tough but fair. If you work hard, you can get a good grade.
    M: Psych sounds nice.
    W: How about we both sign up for psychology? Then we'd be in the same class, and we could help each other with assignments.
    M: I remember the last class we took together. I'm not so sure that's a good idea.
    W: Oh, come on. It would be fun. I promise I'll attend the classes and not just borrow your notes this time.

    W: I'll attend the classes and not just borrow your notes.
    W: I was thinking about taking film studies. Why don't you take that?
    M: I like going to the movies, but I don't want to study them.
    W: I know someone who took the course last year, and she said it's very easy. Almost everyone gets an A or a B. And there is no homework.
    M: That is tempting, but I want to learn something useful.
    W: Fine, but don't complain to me if you get a C.
