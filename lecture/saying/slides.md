# Being ambitious

|	I want to do something big!
|	I want to do something great!
|	I want to do something wonderful!
|	I want to be famous.

# You! Be ambitious!

* Doesn't make sense.

* You're either ambitious or not ambitious.

* Perhaps your parents expected great things
of you, and as a result of that influence
you are ambitious.

* But it's not something you can decide to
be, if you were not ambitious before.

# Things you can be.

|	You're not being quiet. Be quiet!
|	You're not being polite. Be polite.
|	You're not being careful. Be careful.
|	You're being silly. Don't be silly.

# Things you can say.

|	Don't be fooled by liars and tricksters.
|	Try to be a good person.
|	Stand tall, but not, 'Be tall.'

# Things you can't tell someone to be.

|	Be gentlemen!--William S Clark
|	[Be afraid, be very afraid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--hMJPUBwMc)
|		But, 'Don't be afraid,' is OK
|	[Don't worry, be happy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-diB65scQU)

# Be + adjective as a command

The adjective describes behavior
rather than state of mind,
or physical characteristic.

If 'being X' is weird, then
'Be X' as a command is weird, too.

# Boys and girls, be ambitious.

What does it mean?

Motivation is everything.

Nothing succeeds like motivation,
when you're learning a language.

# Nothing succeeds like success.

# What does it mean?

It doesn't make sense.

# The opposite of 

What is success?

Success is going from failure to failure
without loss of confidence.--Winston Churchill

# Winston Churchill

# Nothing succeeds like ..

Nothing succeeds like the confidence that
you can turn failure into success, according
to Winston Churchill.

# Supreme confidence

Confidence unsupported by experience.

# Nothing succeeds like ..

Nothing succeeds like hard work
(the willingness to work hard to 
reach your goal)

# Nothing succeeds like ..

Nothing succeeds like teamwork.

Many hands make light work.

# Nothing succeeds like ..

Nothing succeeds like experience.

Joke: Experience is the best teacher
because it gives the test first and
the lesson after.

# But ..

Nothing succeeds like success.

To be successful, you have to be
successful?

Doh.

# It means:

You must be successful, whatever the cost?

Even if it ruins your life?

# Riddle

* Question: Why will you never starve in the desert?
* Answer: Because of all the sandwiches (=sand which is)
  there.

# Best interpretation of a riddle

Achieving success takes a long time.

To achieve success now, you have to
have been successful before.

Achievement at the end
is guaranteed by success every
step of the way.

# The answer to the riddle

Nothing succeeds like success,
because success is built on
earlier success.

# Another answer

Success encourages you and often
leads to more success.

    "The first quiz the students do
    should be one they can answer
    well. Why? Because the teacher knows 'nothing 
    succeeds like success'."

# My interpretation for language learning

Because motivation is important,
success is important. Success is
motivating, failure demotivating.

Experience success in some part (any part)
of language learning and build on that to
achieve success in other parts.

# A corollary for language learning

It doesn't really matter what I or other people think
is the best way for you to learn.

What YOU think is the best way for you, IS
the best way, the way that is most successful
for you.

# There are many ways to learn

*I* think it's good to have L1 equivalents
for new words.

*You* think it's better not to have L1
equivalents for new words.

Different strokes for different folks!

# Turn on, Tune in, Drop out

# Words, not Ideas

I'm taking the words, but not the ideas.

Drugs, smoking and drinking are bad.

# Timothy Leary (1920-1996)

# [ Turn on, Tune in, Drop out](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tune_in,_turn_on,_drop_out#English)

According to Dr Leary

* Turn on (=take drugs)
* Tune in (=think about values)
* Drop out (=join the counterculture
  & become a hippie)

Not good

# Turn on, Tune in, Drop out

According to Dr Bean

* Turn on (=find learning languages exciting)
* Tune in (=learn about the L2 culture)
* Drop out (=leave the L1 culture,
  join the L2 culture)

Good

# [Turn on](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/turn_on)

Turn back/around/up/down/in, etc

* Turn on a tap, light, TV, radio, washing machine
* Turn someone on (=excite them sexually, or with drugs,
  or some other thing)

# [Tune in](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/tune_in)

* Tune a piano, car
* Select a radio station, TV channel
* To pay attention to, be aware of, and follow something

# [Drop out](https://www.bestcolleges.com/research/college-dropout-rate/)

* 17% of all Americans have dropped out.
* 25% of first-year students drop out.
* 32% of all students drop out.

But, drop out rates are decreasing, 

At public four-year institutions
the dropout rate in the first year
is 17.6%, which is the lowest rate.

And, there are more women in college
than men.

# Counterculture

A culture with values and behavior very different
from those of mainstream society, sometimes in a
relationship of conflict with mainstream society.

# Taiwan counterculture

In the context of Taiwan, mainstream American culture
(or mainstream Western culture, in general) is a
counterculture.

At home, a mainstream culture, a counterculture
abroad.

# American counterculture

In the American context, hippies became the largest
and most visible countercultural group in the late
1960s.

The hipsters were an earlier, smaller countercultural
group from the 1940s to 1950s.

# Dr Bean as countercultural figure

In Australia, I'm a member of
mainstream Australian society.

In Taiwan, I'm a member of a
counterculture.

A representative of a counterculture.

# You as countercultural figure

In Taiwan, you're a member of
mainstream Taiwanese society.

In Australia and elsewhere, you're a 
member of a counterculture.

A representative of a counterculture.

'Oh, you're from Taiwan.'

# Counter

* counterclockwise (=anti-clockwise)
* counterespionage (=detecting and countering foreign spies)
* counterattack (=an attack made in response to an attack made by another)

# Dr Bean's advice

Drop out (but
graduate from NUU first.)

Travel overseas.

Don't look back.

Live with the other people,
whether French, Japanese,
Vietnamese, Australians,
South Africans, Bolivians,
Nigerians, Russians!

Learn their language!

It's wonderful!

# Dr Bean's story

I learned Japanese by myself from 1978 
to 1980 before going to Japan.

I lived in Korea from 1986 to 1996.

I came to Taiwan in 1999. I taught at 
NUU from 2008 to 2020.
