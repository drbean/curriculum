![Boys, Be Ambitious](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse4.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.8Qmw_1_HAlbcq1fFmxH17wHaFj%26pid%3DApi&f=1)

# Being ambitious

|	I want to do something big!
|	I want to do something great!
|	I want to do something wonderful!
|	I want to be famous.

# You! Be ambitious!

* Doesn't make sense.

* You're either ambitious or not ambitious.

* Perhaps your parents expected great things
of you, and as a result of that influence
you are ambitious.

* But it's not something you can decide to
be, if you were not ambitious before.

# Things you can and can't be.

|	You're not being quiet. Be quiet!
|	You're not being polite. Be polite.
|	You're not being careful. Be careful.
|	You're being silly. Don't be silly.

|	Don't be fooled by liars and tricksters.
|	Try to be a good person.
|	Stand tall, but not, 'Be tall.'

|	Be gentlemen!--William S Clark
|	[Be afraid, be very afraid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--hMJPUBwMc)
|		But, 'Don't be afraid,' is OK
|	[Don't worry, be happy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-diB65scQU)

# Be + adjective as a command

The adjective describes behavior
rather than state of mind,
or physical characteristic.

If 'being X' is weird, then
'Be X' as a command is weird, too.

# Boys and girls, be ambitious.

What does it mean?

Motivation is everything.

Nothing succeeds like motivation,
when you're learning a language.

# Nothing succeeds like success.

# What does it mean?

It doesn't make sense.

# The opposite of 

What is success?

Success is going from failure to failure
without loss of confidence.--Winston Churchill

# Winston Churchill

The V-sign

# Nothing succeeds like ..

Nothing succeeds like the confidence that
you can turn failure into success, according
to Winston Churchill.

# Supreme confidence

Confidence unsupported by experience.

# Nothing succeeds like ..

Nothing succeeds like hard work
(the willingness to work hard to 
reach your goal)

# Nothing succeeds like ..

Nothing succeeds like teamwork.

Many hands make light work.

# Nothing succeeds like ..

Nothing succeeds like experience.

Joke: Experience is the best teacher
because it gives the test first and
the lesson after.

# But ..

Nothing succeeds like success.

To be successful, you have to be
successful?

Doh.

# It means:

You must be successful, whatever the cost?

Even if it ruins your life?

# Best interpretation of a riddle

Achieving success takes a long time.

Achievement at the end
is guaranteed by success every
step of the way.

# My interpretation for language learning

Because motivation is so important,
success is important. Success is
motivating. Failure is demotivating.

Experience success in some part (any part)
of language learning and build on that to
achieve success in other parts.

# A corollary for language learning

It doesn't really matter what I or other people think
is the best way for you to learn.

What YOU think is the best way for you, IS
the best way, the way that is most successful
for you.

# There are many ways to learn

*I* think it's good to have L1 equivalents
for new words.

*You* think it's better not to have L1
equivalents for new words.

Different strokes for different folks!
