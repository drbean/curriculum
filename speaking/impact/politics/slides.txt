## Steve Hoover and his wife

- Steve (I think) has good things to say about the DPP, despite Chen SuiBian.
- Steve's wife is Hakka, and apparently supports the KMT, judging from what he has said to me.

Ask him.

The Hakka have traditionally supported the KMT, haven't they?

They have opposed Taiwanese independence movements for hundreds of years, haven't they?

# Points of view

## Annan, Jin-Sook argue about politics

1. Jin-sook says, "It's a good idea to have extremists to keep moderates on their toes." Does she mean:

- Extremists can be good for a society to have
- Extremists should be eliminated and replaced with moderates

2. "To keep a person on his/her toes" is an idiom from boxing, a martial art. In this situation, it means to

- force moderates into a bad position, where they cannot respond to changes
- make moderates active, aware and responsive, ready to react to changes

3. Who is the idealist? Who is the realist? What makes you think so?

- Annan, Jin-Sook
- Jin-Sook, Annan

4. Who is idealistic about extremism?

- Annan
- Jin-Sook
