# Talking 

## Talking about injuries

The tear on the palm of my hand.

My father's boat had a piece of wire on the side of the boat. I grabbed it when I jumped into the water. It tore a hole in my hand.

I wanted my dad to pay the hospital fee. I never paid it.

## Role for Danly in CompComp activity

Danly's English ability is way higher than anyone else here at MUST and anyone in this class.

Getting her to compete with another student, the winner is a foregone conclusion.

## A special role for Danly in the 2-person CompComp activity 

- Listening to/advising/judging the White and Black pairs

I want her to listen to the answers Black and White give to each other's questions

She will act as a gateway that the pairs move through before I listen to their answers. This will allow the pairs to practice.

## Danly's grade

Her grade will be how well she does her job. 

- 5 if she does a good job.
- 4 if I have serious concerns.

I will want her to check the pairs have filled out the form correctly.
