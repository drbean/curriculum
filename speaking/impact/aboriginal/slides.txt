The Discussion on the 3rd page is the REAL THING.

# Australian aborigines

## Dr Bean's experience

I lived with a tribe of Australian aborigines in the north of Australia from 1976 to 1980, before leaving Australia for Japan.

If I went back to Australia, I would again go back to living with aborigines.

## Dr Bean's feelings about primitive people

I have the greatest respect for primitive people. They are not superior or inferior to people of "advanced" civilizations.

Their material culture (food, clothing, shelter) and spritual culture (religion, science, politics) may be simple, but ..

People of "advanced" cultures are not superior as individuals. Taiwanese, Americans, Japanese are dependent on their cultures. Take their cultures away from them, and they are less capable than aboriginal people.

## Problems of aboriginals

Their lifestyles are under pressure from advanced cultures. They have less and white people have more. They become dependent on white European culture, not working, drinking all the time, and using English and forgetting their native laguages.

## Aboriginal workers

There is nothing they have that they can trade with white people. The group I was living with made/caught/sometimes worked as:
