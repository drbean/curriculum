## Escort services

Is it OK for a woman to go on a date for money?

[Gillian says it is OK.](http://www.impactseries.com/Issues_new/personal_opinion/3_8.mov)

I don't think it is good for a woman to have sex for money.

- The work environment (ie people, work conditions) sex workers have to work in isn't good.

We need to distinguish between escort services and prostitution, even though escort agencies often provide a cover for prostitution.

[Escort agency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escort_agency)

## 2 questions for the exam

What question do you want your partner to ask you about:

- money and you
- money and society

in the exam?

## Personalization

One student from each group reads a sentence about themselves using the words,

- I tend to forget ...
- When I focus on ...

# Expectations of people with money/without money: An activity

## What do people with money expect from people without money?

eg, obedient, helpful etc

## What do people without money think of people with money?

eg resentment, expectations of generosity, etc

# Activity: What do the rich expect of the poor? What do the poor want from the rich?

## 1. Groups split up into persons who think money is more important than love and persons who think love is more important than money

Write on card what you expect from the opposite group.

- If you think money is more important, you are rich.
- If you think love is more important, you are poor.

Distribute cards to other groups.

## 2. Write on other card, what you have a concern with as a member of your own group.

What are you interested in?

The rich! Do you spend your money? Do you have a good life? Are you successful? Are you concerned about the poor? Do you want them to work for you?

The poor! Are you conscious of your lack of money? Do you want more money? Is it important for you to have the rich support the poor? Do you want people to be less concerned about money?

Discuss cards, choose champions, Return to original group.

## 3. Champions answer questions from groups

3 Champions (money-is-most-important group first) stand at front. Or in "hot seat," answer questions.

Change over (love-is-most-important group to front), answer questions.
