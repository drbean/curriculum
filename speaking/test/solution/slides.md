# Problem--solution

# Call centers

## Hard work

### Computer problem service center

Center worker: "Press any key to continue!"

Caller: "I can't find the 'any' key!!"

Don't be depressed if it is difficult communicating over the phone.

## Other telephone situations that may feature in Question 10--Propose a solution

- [Hotline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline)

- [Complaint_system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint_system)

- [Crisis_hotline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_hotline)


## Interactive

No chance to

* check understanding
* request clarification

## Intercultural communication

Rule of intercultural communication:

People have different, *mistaken* understandings of what the other person is saying, because of different backgrounds.

- [Americans unhappy with Chinese not being more direct when they disagree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4HB1aUE4p4)

But I was unhappy when the assistant in the Language Center office said, "No, you can't do that."

## Propose a solution

	Directions: In this part of the test, you will be presented
	with a problem and asked to propose a solution. You
	will have 45 seconds to prepare. Then you will have 60
	seconds to speak.

	Respond as if you work at the bank.

The problem/solution situation has standard ways to handle.

You can improve your performance in it by practicing different telephone problems/solutions.

## Big picture and details

You need to understand *the big picture*

"You lost your passport and want us to help."

You need to remember *the details*

"You had it yesterday when you were at the passport office ..."

## Notes OK

"
One change is related to note-taking. Up until now, taking note during the administration of the TOEIC® Speaking and Writing tests were forbidden. Effective June 1st, 2019 note taking will now be allowed during the test administrations.
"

Chinese notes presumably Ok. They're not going to outlaw a language.

## Your response

In your response, be sure to

* show that you recognise the problem, and
* propose a way of dealing with the problem.

## Part 1: show that you recognise the problem

"Let me just check that I understand what the problem is. You're saying ..."

Plus:

* the big picture,
* then the details

## end part 1

	"Is that correct?"
	"Please confirm that this is correct."
	"Contact me if I made a mistake here"

## transition into part 2

Pause.

	"OK"

## Part 2: Ipropose a way of dealing with the problem

First, say what you have done:

	"I have contacted the people responsible for ..."

And what the consequences of that were

	"They told me that ..."

## part 2 II: propose a way of dealing with the problem

Then, say what the caller can (has to) do.

Don't be afraid to require the caller to do something onerous.

	"I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to .."

	"You will have to .."

* some difficult requirement for the caller

## Don't use "please", "You'd better"

You're not giving advice, so don't use "should", either.

## the consequences of caller doing their part

	"If you [do this], we will be able to
	[do this other thing] (which will solve
	the problem)"

## conditions on satisfactory solution

### Conditions the caller needs to satisfy

You can use "Please", or "should"

	"Please do this [by some time|at some place|
	in some manner], so we can ..."

### Conditions the responder needs to satisfy

	"If we can't [do some helpful thing for you],
	we won't be able to .."
