# Problem--solution

# Call centers

## Hard work

### Computer problem service center

Center worker: "Press any key to continue!"

Caller: "I can't find the 'any' key!!"

Don't be depressed if it is difficult communicating over the phone.

## Other telephone situations that may feature in Question 10--Propose a solution

- [Hotline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotline)

- [Complaint_system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complaint_system)

- [Crisis_hotline](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crisis_hotline)


## Interactive

No chance to

* check understanding
* request clarification

## Intercultural communication

Rule of intercultural communication:

People have different, *mistaken* understandings of what the other person is saying, because of different backgrounds.

- [Americans unhappy with Chinese not being more direct when they disagree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z4HB1aUE4p4)

But I was unhappy when the assistant in the Language Center office said, "No, you can't do that."

## Propose a solution

	Directions: In this part of the test, you will be presented
	with a problem and asked to propose a solution. You
	will have 45 seconds to prepare. Then you will have 60
	seconds to speak.

	Respond as if you work at the bank.

The problem/solution situation has standard ways to handle.

You can improve your performance in it by practicing different telephone problems/solutions.

## Big picture and details

You need to understand *the big picture*

"You lost your passport and want us to help."

You need to remember *the details*

"You had it yesterday when you were at the passport office ..."

## Notes OK

"
One change is related to note-taking. Up until now, taking note during the administration of the TOEIC® Speaking and Writing tests were forbidden. Effective June 1st, 2019 note taking will now be allowed during the test administrations.
"

Chinese notes presumably Ok. They're not going to outlaw a language.

[Evaluation:](https://framenet2.icsi.berkeley.edu/fnReports/data/frameIndex.xml?frame=Assessing)

You, the responder: That way, it should arrive at your house in two days, so you will have some time to start reading the books before your class begins. 

Assessing 'Frame'

## Your response

In your response, be sure to

* show that you recognise the problem, and
* propose a way of dealing with the problem.

## Part 1: show that you recognise the problem

"Let me just check that I understand what the problem is. You're saying ..."

Plus:

* the big picture,
* then the details

## end part 1

	"Is that correct?"
	"Please confirm that this is correct."
	"Please correct me if I made a mistake."
	"Please correct me if that is not correct."
	"Contact me if I made a mistake here."

## Clarification questions

* WH questions

	"Where did X .."
	"What is/are X .."
	"How many X .."
	"When will X .."
	"Why are you .."
	"Who is going to .."

* YN questions

	"Can/Are/Did/Do you/X .."

## Listening problems

It's better to admit a problem than to try to hide the fact you don't understand.

	"I didn't catch the bit about X"
	"I'm sorry. I didn't understand where/what X .."

## transition into part 2

Pause.

	"OK"
	"Anyway" (if you have a problem with understanding a lot of the problem)

## Part 2: propose a way of dealing with the problem

First, say what you have done:

	"I have contacted the people responsible for ..."

And what the consequences of that were

	"They told me that ..."

## part 2 II: propose a way of dealing with the problem

Then, say what the caller can (has to) do.

Don't be afraid to require the caller to do something onerous.

	"I'm afraid I'm going to have to ask you to .."

	"You will have to .."

* some difficult requirement for the caller

## Don't use "please", "You'd better"

You're not giving advice, so don't use "should", either.

## the consequences of caller doing their part

	"If you [do this], we will be able to
	[do this other thing] (which will solve
	the problem)"

## conditions on satisfactory solution

### Conditions the caller needs to satisfy

You can use "Please", or "should"

	"Please do this [by some time|at some place|
	in some manner], so we can ..."

### Conditions the responder needs to satisfy

	"If we can't [do some helpful thing for you],
	we won't be able to .."

## [Full Speaking toeic test 01 | Practice Speaking toeic test with Answers ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-49s5HgVGo)

	Hello, this is Sam Webster. I'm calling about some 
	books I ordered from your company recently. When I 
	placed the order, I was told that the books would 
	arrive within five business days. But now, two weeks 
	have passed and the books still haven't arrived.

	I need them for a class I'm taking, which begins 
	next Monday. I will definitely need the books by 
	then. And I was hoping to have them before then, so 
	I could have a chance to start reading before the 
	class begins.

	Is there some way I can find out where the package 
	with my books is? And how soon it will arrive?

	Thank you.

# Book delay solution

## A good response

Hello, Mr Webster. Thank you for your call about the books you ordered.
I'm sorry you've been waiting so long to receive them. I know how important
those books are you. It seems that there was a delay in sending your package,
so unfortunately it might be another week before it arrives.

However I am going to send you a new package with the same books. I am going 
to send it by express mail this afternoon. That way, it should arrive at your
house in two days, so you will have some time to start reading the books
before your class begins. Of course, there will be no extra charge for this.
Thank you very much for your patience. Please let me know if you have more

Hello, this is a message for Ms Peters. I'm calling from Dr Warren's office. You asked for an emergency appointment this morning, but I'm afraid that the doctor is completely booked.

If that time isn't good for you, the doctor can see you at 5:30 this afternoon, or I can give you an appointment early tomorrow morning. Please let me know which would work best for you.

## An embarrassment of riches

## full text--problem

| I have one last thing to discuss with you at this sales manager meeting. 
| As you know our customers are greatly satisfied with our monthly promotions that offer shoes at reasonable prices.
| And next month we are going to hold a special promotion on running shoes.
| We have several different models to present to the customers.
| However we have limited space to display the running shoes.
| 
| It sounds like we will have to make a choice on which shoes should go on display, considering the popularity and profit margin we will be making.
| 
| That is the point. How should we choose which running shoes models to display at the store during the promotion?
| I hope to hear an idea from all of you after the meeting.
| Please leave me a message by tomorrow.
| Thank you.

## full text--solution part 1

| Hello. This is Gwen.
| I heard we are going to hold a special promotion on running shoes.
| However, there is a problem, because there are too many models.
| And you don't know which ones to choose for display.
| So you'd like to get some help with this matter.
| First of all, I'm sorry to hear about the situation.
| However, I'm happy to say there is a way to help you out.

## full text--solution part 2

| After looking into the situation, I came up with the following suggestions:
| I think it is a good idea to do a survey and choose more popular ones.
| That should be helpful.
| Moreover, why don't we display cheaper shoes.
| That should be helpful to sell more.
| Those are my suggestions.
| If you need more help, feel free to call me back any time.
| Bye.
