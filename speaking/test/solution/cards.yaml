      identifier: "Question 10: Propose a solution to passport left in taxi"
      rubric: |+
        In this part of the test, you will be presented with a problem and asked to propose a solution . You will have 45 seconds to prepare. Then you will have 60 seconds to speak.

        Respond as if you work for the taxi company. In your response, be sure to 

        - show that you recognize the problem, and
        - propose a way of dealing with the problem.

        Now listen to the voice message (here, transcribed to text, but in the test, you only hear the message, which makes it quite difficult to get all the details, and requires you to take notes.)

        Hello, this is Nancy Polanski. I'm calling from the airport. One of your taxis dropped me off at the international departure terminal 20 minutes ago. I think my passport got left behind in the taxi. I noticed it was missing when I checked in with the airline. I can't find it in my purse or my carry-on bag. I've retraced my route since arriving, and I cannot locate it. My passport must still be in the taxi. I don't remember the driver's name. Part of his licence number is 3562. Can you please find the driver and ask him to look for it? I can't miss my flight. It's leaving in an hour. I'll pay for it to be delivered to me. Please call me as soon as possible. My number is 555-8890. Thank-you.
