# Respond to a request

## request or offer

Request: Please do something for me
Offer: Let me do something for you

## Problems with Respond to written request

- Too short
- 'To Whom It May Concern' should be 'Dear Dale City Welcome Committee'.
	- or Dear Welcome Committee
	- or Dear Committee
- Email headers a good idea, but From: line is important
- Politeness [forms of address](https://englishwithkim.com/polite-titles-forms-address/)
- punctuation is *followed by a space.*
- 'I want to know about city tax' is too broad for the person receiving your response to answer. You need to specify in more detail your situation.
	- For example, you need to specify your address (make it up)

## Awareness of audience

Remember who will be trying to follow up with your request--perhaps he/she is an overworked volunteer.

The more detail you can give the better.
