# The fruit stall/stand picture

# Thoughts on listening to the homework

## Describe, not create a story

Imagining something about the picture, or putting yourself in the situation in the picture, is *dangerous*, I think.

The instructions say, "In this part of the test, you will *describe* the
picture on your screen in as much detail as you can."

I think a rater might not be happy to hear you be *creative* and to imagine some interesting thing that is happening, but for which there is no *objective* evidence.

## Putting yourself in the picture (not recommended)

If you want to put yourself in the picture, you could say:

* "If I were there, I would .."

## If you want to be creative (not recommended)

If you want to use your imagination, you could say:

Something objective, followed by an inference with a
[hedge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hedge)

* "The woman in the bottom left-hand corner is fat. *Perhaps* she likes to eat a lot of fruit."

## Tense

Imagine the picture is real, here, now!

Use the present continuous tense with most verbs, except "have", "like", "know", etc

Use simple present with adjectives.

You don't need to add, "in the picture," to many sentences, but it is OK to do it some times.

## Referring to self

Using "I" talking about a picture is _not recommended._

The answer most expected by raters will not use "I"

If you do use, "I see" (NOT: "I saw") 

then you can say, "I can't see what she is holding."

Otherwise, you have to say, "It's not clear what she's holding."

## Objective description

"There is an X Y-ing Z in the A."

"There is someone doing something in the (bottom left-hand) corner."

## Summary, main point, structure

A *short* summary is OK, but not necessary.

However, having some structure in mind for your description of the picture *is* important. Connect everything you say with some point, the *main point* about the picture.

# Metonym

## Definition

metonym — Noun:1. (grammar) A word that names an object from a single characteristic of it or of a closely related object; a word used in metonymy., 2. (by extension) A concept, idea, or word used to represent, typify, or stand in for a broader set of ideas. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/metonym

## Fruit, vehicles, things and organizations

An orange, banana and some strange fruit whose name I don't know are all *fruit*.

A truck, bicycle, scooter, horse, airplane are all *vehicles*. Well, I don't know about the horse and airplane.

A piece of metal, a bag, a piece of paper, and an orange are all *things*.

The U.N., Japanese Diet, Australian House of Representatives are all political *organizations*.

*fruit*, *vehicles*, *things* and *organizations* are all METONYMS.

## Metonyms for describing pictures

Metonyms are good to know!

A husband, old man, child, corpse are *hyponyms* of person. Well, actually, a corpse is a dead person, but it isn't a person.

If you can say, "A horse is an animal", then you know that:

* 'horse' is a hyponym of 'animal',
* and 'animal' is a metonym of 'horse'.

If you know the metonym, it doesn't matter if you don't know the hyponym. That's why metonyms are useful.
