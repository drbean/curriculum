# handbook:
# Language skill levels are related because of the nature of
# language learning; the skills of listening and speaking or
# of reading and writing are often used together. For most
# people, there is quite a strong correlation among the four
# language skills. Over time, however, if you practice some
# skills (for example, reading and listening) much more
# often than you practice others, then the correlation may
# change. While the TOEIC Listening and Reading tests are
# indirect measures of speaking and writing proficiency,
# the TOEIC Speaking and Writing tests are more direct
# measures of productive skills.
