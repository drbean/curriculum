      identifier: Question 1~2. Read a text aloud
      rubric: |+
        Directions: In this part of the test, you will read aloud the text in the paragraph below. You will have 45 seconds to read the text aloud. Record by pushing the Microphone button in the editor, or attach a sound file, by pushing the button with the video camera to the left. Submit after choosing a good title for the reading (use keywords from the text!)

        For most people, there is quite a strong correlation among the four language skills. Over time, however, if you practice reading and listening much more often than you practice speaking and writing, then the correlation may change, and the TOEIC Listening and Reading tests will not be a good measure of your speaking and writing ability. While the TOEIC Listening and Reading tests are indirect measures of speaking and writing proficiency, the TOEIC Speaking and Writing tests are more direct measures of productive skills.
