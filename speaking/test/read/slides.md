# Official Examinee handbook

## Vacation suggestion

While reading the text, try to understand it. And divide it into paragraphs. Pick out the most important words. They need to be spoken louder and higher and more slowly. The other words are less emphasized: quieter, fewer intonation changes and faster.

## Avoid stress

	If  you’re  shopping,  sightseeing,  and  
	running  around  every  minute,  your  
	vacation  can  seem  like  *hard  work*.  
	To  avoid  vacation  stress,  come  to  
	the  *Blue  Valley  Inn*  on beautiful 
	Lake Mead.

## Attractions of the location

	While staying at our inn, you’ll breathe  
	*clean  country  air*  as  you  view  
	spectacular  sights.  With  its  
	spacious  rooms,  swimming  pool,  and  
	many outdoor activities, the inn is the 
	*perfect place* for a vacation you won’t 
	forget.

## Inn's relationships with guests

	The Blue Valley Inn prides itself  on  
	the  *personal  attention*  it  provides  
	for  every  guest. The Blue Valley motto 
	has always been, A *happy guest* is our 
	greatest treasure.
