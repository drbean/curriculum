## Question 7

	I'm interested in taking the tour of the Botanical
	Gardens on June 5th.

	But I'm not sure where exactly I should go.

	Can you tell me where the tour begins?


## Question 8

	Can you tell me how much the tickets for the tour cost?

## Question 9

	I understand the tour lasts for several hours. And I'm 
	afraid I might get hungry in that time.

	Will any meals be served during the tour?
