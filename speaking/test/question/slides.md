# Questions 4–6 Respond to Questions

## Examinee handbook example

Directions: In this part of the test, you will answer three
questions. You will have three seconds to prepare after
you hear each question. You will have 15 seconds to
respond to Questions 4 and 5, and 30 seconds to respond
to Question 6.

research in your country. You have agreed to participate
in a telephone interview about television viewing.

- Question 5: What kinds of programmes do you usually watch?
- Question 6: Describe your favourite television programme.
