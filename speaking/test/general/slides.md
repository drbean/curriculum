## TOEIC measures to cope with COVID-19 in France

- [https://www.etsglobal.org/fr/en/blog/news/covid-19-and-curfew-information-on-test-sessions](https://www.etsglobal.org/fr/en/blog/news/covid-19-and-curfew-information-on-test-sessions)

# General level issues

# Exams

## Midterm, final exams

This course to some degree simulates the TOEIC test experience, which is done on a computer with headphones.

Try to grade your answers the way an actual test rater would score you.

Don't be depressed about your English if the scores are low.

# Scores

# Course grade does not equal TOEIC score

## Struggling student gets good grade

A struggling student:

* Tries hard
* Does homework
* Accesses course each week
* Performs _badly_ on TOEIC practice tests

⇒ A good grade

## Near-native speaker gets bad grade

A returnee from the US where he/she went at age of 7 years:

* Doesn't try hard
* Does no homework
* Not accessing the course each week
* _Aces_ TOEIC practice test Week 9, 18

⇒ ot good, might even fail on real test

## Moral of the story: test success does not equal life success

Success on tests or at college does not translate into success in life, or in a career.

It helps, but a test is just a test and not life.

Look at me! I am an example of superior testing performance, but low life success.

## But TOEIC speaking/writing test is a good test

The TOEIC listening/reading test is not good.

- [Page 4 of TOEIC Speaking/Writing Examinee Handbook ](http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/toeic/sample/TOEIC Speaking and Writing tests Examinee Handbook.pdf)

You can get good scores on the TOEIC listening/reading test but not be able to speak any English at all!

# Not happy about students not doing a lot of work

## Students safe from failing

If you stay to the end of the course and appear at the final exam, you are guaranteed 70/100

## Homework and classwork important

The classwork exercises are my way of teaching you the content of the course

If you are not doing them, you're not learning what I want to teach.

The homework is also the way to practice for the test. If you're not doing it, you can't improve.

So, I'm making classwork and homework 40 percent of the grade each.

Midterm and final exams are only 20 percent.

# Looking for sample tests

## Extra credit for students posting links to testing material

Please post links to online TOEIC, TOEFL and IELTS speaking/writing tests

Or books with TOEIC speaking/writing tests.

In the subject line, 2~3 word description, eg Testden test

In the message itself, write the link, eg http:example.com/test/practice_test.pdf

If it is in a book, give the name of the book and authors.

I will give extra credit for posts

## Regional standards

TOEIC is incorporating native speakers of English from countries outside the U.S. like Canada, the U.K., Australia and New Zealand, and possible South Africa, but not from other countries where English is an official language, like India, or where the language is spoken widely as a second language, like Germany and Denmark.

* 'I told her I loved her.'

say *some sentence* to *someone*

* 'Teachers speak too much and the students don't speak enough.'
