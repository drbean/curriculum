        Welcome to Teach yourself TOEIC Speaking.

        What can you do on this site? You can practice recording your answers to TOEIC questions, listen to TOEIC test material, learn about the TOEIC test procedure. And more.

        1. Login with your Username, which is your id and your password (Well, you've already been successful with that.)

        2. Then start at the exercise in Week 1: Question 3: describe a picture. You have to speak for 45 seconds about the picture.

        3. Then open the 'Homework: Fruit stall recording' exercise, record a conversation on your device, and upload it, following the instructions in the exercise.

        This procedure is not easy, so I can understand if you are not able to complete it. If you are able to login, but do not know what to do next, you can send me a message on the site.

        Click 'Participants' in the top left-hand corner, find my name (Dr Bean) among the list of students, And then on "With Selected Users", choose "Send a message"

        The course concentrates on speaking. Students feel a greater need to practice speaking, even though writing is probably has a greater influence on one's career success.

        Hi. This is Myra Peters, calling about my appointment with Dr. Jones. I have a three o'clock appointment scheduled for this afternoon. Unfortunately, I won't be able to keep it because of an important meeting at work. So, I'll need to reschedule. I was hoping to come in sometime next week. Any time Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday afternoon would work for me. I hope the doctor has some time available on one of those days. Please call me back and let me know.

        When looking for a place to live, most people think about convenience. If they are parents with children, they want to live near the best schools. They want to have public transportation or good road available to them. They don't want to have to travel far for shopping and entertainment. People also enjoy living near a park or gym so that they have easy access to recreation. And, of course, for the majority of people the most important thing is to live in close proximity to their jobs.

        When you go to a job interview, it is important to make a good impression. The first thing the interviewer will observe about you is your clothes, so dress in a neat, conservative outfit. Dark colors are best. Men should wear simple ties, and women should not wear short skirts. The way you behave is equally important. Enter the room with confidence. Look the interviewer in the eye while shaking hands. Don't forget to smile pleasantly at the same time. Introduce yourself in a clear voice.

# 9:28 Hello. Is this the karate school? I would like some information about karate lessons for my son. I know you give classes for children, but I think they're group classes. My son is very shy and he doesn't do well in groups. Also, I noticed in your ad that your classes started last week. My son really wants to take karate lessons this semester and the only reason we didn't sign up earlier is because we were away on vacation. Do you have a class my son can take? He's ten years old and he has never taken karate lessons before. He has times in the afternoons after school and on Saturdays. My name is Sam Lee and my number is 876-555-9876. Thank you.

# Hello, this is Barbara Peters. I'm a patient of Dr Warren. I have a dental emergency. I mean, I think it is an emergency. Anyhow, my tooth has been bothering me since yesterday. It started to ache a little in the afternoon. Then the pain got so bad at night, that I didn't sleep well. Would the doctor have time to see me today. I have an important meeting this afternoon, so I would really like to see him this morning, if possible. The pain is really bad. It's bothering me a lot and just keeps getting worse. My job is not too far from your office. I can be there in 15 minutes. if I take a cab. Here is my cell phone number, 342-555-0965. Again, my name is Barbara Peters. I know the doctor's schedule is really full, but I really hope he can help me this morning. Thanks.
