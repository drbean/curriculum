# General level issues

# Exams

## Midterm, final exams

My plan is to try to simulate the TOEIC test experience under exam conditions xcin Week 9, 18 in the computer lab.

I will try to grade your answers the way an actual test rater would score you.

Don't be depressed about the course if they are low.

# Scores

# Course grade does not equal TOEIC score

## Struggling student gets good grade

A struggling student:

* Tries hard
* Does all homework
* In class each week
* Performs _badly_ on TOEIC practice test Week 9, 18

⇒ A good grade

## Near-native speaker gets bad grade

A returnee from the US where he/she went at age of 7 years:

* Doesn't try hard
* Does no homework
* Not in class each week
* _Aces_ TOEIC practice test Week 9, 18

⇒ Not a good grade, might even fail

## Moral of the story: test success does not equal life success

Success on tests or at college does not translate into success in life, or in a career.

It helps, but a test is just a test and not life.

Look at me! I am an example of superior testing performance, but low life success.

## But TOEIC speaking/writing test is a good test

The TOEIC listening/reading test this weekend is not good.

- [Page 4 of TOEIC Speaking/Writing Examinee Handbook ](https://www.etsglobal.org/content/download/828/12618/version/5/file/Examinee+Handbook+-+TOEIC+Speaking+and+Writing-LR.pdf)

You can get good scores on the TOEIC listening/reading test but not be able to speak any English at all!

# Looking for sample tests

## Extra credit for students posting links to testing material

Please post links to online TOEIC, TOEFL and IELTS speaking/writing tests

Or books with TOEIC speaking/writing tests.

In the subject line, 2~3 word description, eg Testden test

In the message itself, write the link, eg http:example.com/test/practice_test.pdf

If it is in a book, give the name of the book and authors.

I will give extra credit for posts
