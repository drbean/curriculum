# Scholarship interview simulation

A committee of 6 Taiwanese government & 
company representatives has money 
for students to live overseas.

It will give some to all, but more to 
students with greater intercultural 
communicative competence.

# You, as students

Choose which country to go to, but 
convince the committee you have
the 5 intercultural skills (and can 
speak English).

The 'beans' you get from the committee
are your grade for the class.

# Beans

For each of the 5 intercultural skills
plus English ability, each committee 
member decides to award either
[2 or 3](http://drbean.sdf.org/intercultural/eval_savoir.pdf)
beans.

Then each of the 6 committee members hands over
a total of 10, 11, 13, 14, 16, or 17 
beans.

# [Beans](http://drbean.sdf.org/topics/seventeen_bean.pdf)

Make sure you get 6 beans from all committee members.

The 'beans' you get from the committee
are your grade for the class.

# On return

You join the committee and award your 
remaining 'beans' (NOT the beans you got 
from the committee) to following students.

* Keep the beans you were AWARDED separate.
Don't lose them. They are your grade.

# Committee questions

* Why do you want to go there?
* How much do you know about their 
  customs?
* Why would life there be interesting?
* How well will you be able to relate 
  strange customs to Taiwanese culture?
* Will it be easy for you to fit in?
* How will you solve communication problems?
* Will you be able to justify your 
  opinions about life there?

# Simulation procedure--3 stages

# Interview

* Interviewee-interviewers talk about 
the culture. Interviewers ask about &
interviewee tries to show the 5 savoirs 
and English ability.

* Interviewers award beans, totaling 60~100.

# Metamorphosis

## Interviewee-to-interviewer

* Interviewee joins the committee, 
  becoming an interviewER.

## Interviewer-to-interviewee

* Interviewer 1 leaves for an interview 
  with the next committee and committee 
  member 1 from the committee on the 
  other side comes to be interviewed.

# Awarding beans

Each committee member has only 6 
different value beans for the 6 
interviewees.

# Awarding beans

Each committee member has no choice 
about the beans to be awarded the last
interviewee.

# Awarding beans

Keep in mind how many more interviewees 
remain. Try to predict how well they 
will do.

# 2 sets of beans

Some committees only have 5 members.

I will give an extra set of beans to
one member.

When that member leaves, give the 
remaining beans in the set (maybe only 
1) to another member to give to 
interviewees.

what I would like to know about, but not 
about what I DO know about.

# Savoir 3--Comparison/contrast

# Savoir 3--Comparison/contrast

* Careful (passive), rather than 
  masterly (active)
* Patient, accept ambiguity/confusion

Good communicator learners are not 
afraid of making mistakes. In the other 
culture, they LIKE making mistakes, and 
learn from their mistakes.

    * good/bad judgments impossible
        * 2 sides to every question
	* [double standards](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=double+standards)

# Right committee response

* 2 beans

I AVOID making judgments and have 
REASONS for doing that.

# Homework

* Savoir 2. Find out some cultural facts/way of 
  life in that country.
* Savoir 3. Interpret those facts in 
  terms of Taiwanese culture.
* Savoir 4. Think about communication 
  problems (NOT language problems) 
  there. How would you solve them?
