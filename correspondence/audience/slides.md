# Audience

## 8 Cs

The 8 Cs are what you need to think about when you are writing your message. They are about the content of your message.

But there are other things to think about.

You need to think not just about your message, but also how your audience is going to *react* to your message.

## Audience = readers

Who are they?

What are they thinking?

## Spam--when the audience doesn't know who you are

If you don't know, then you are writing spam:

bad -> spam

neutral -> unsolicited commercial email

## Audience interest

How involved are they in the topic?

## Audience knowledge

What do they know about the topic?

## Audience purpose

Why are they reading the message? What do they intend to do after reading it?

## Audience point of view

What is their feeling about the topic?

## Audience relationship with writer

Are they:

* a co-worker
* a customer
* a business friend
* an underling :-)

## Audience preferred style

Do they like to:

* make jokes
* be friendly
* be polite
* be business-like
* be threatening
