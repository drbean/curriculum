        Write a dialog like Dr Bean's watermelon buying one that includes the Introduction/promotion, Inquiry, Offer/quotation and Order stages

        Identify the 3 stages, like this:

        *  Seller: Watermelon! Buy this watermelon! (Promotion/introduction)
        *  Buyer: How much is the watermelon? (Inquiry)
        *  Seller: It's 15NT per kilogram (Offer/quotation)
        *  Buyer: Give me this one. (Order)


        NO PLAGIARISM!

      identifier: "Homework: Introduction, Inquiry, Offer, Order--your story"
      rubric: |+
        Write a story about when you bought something. 

        Divide it into 4 lines with the headings: Introduction/promotion, Inquiry, Offer, Order.

        For example:

        ## Introduction/promotion

        I saw a sign advertising shoes.

        ## Inquiry

        I asked if they had jogging shoes, and they showed me some shoes, which I liked. I asked how much they cost.

        ## Offer

        They said the jogging shoes were 200 NT.

        ## Order

        I said, OK, and bought them.

        ## You *must* have the 4 headings.
