Write a dialog like Dr Bean's watermelon buying one that includes the Introduction/promotion, Inquiry, Offer/quotation and Order stages

Identify the 3 stages, like this:

*  Seller: Watermelon! Buy this watermelon! (Promotion/introduction)
*  Buyer: How much is the watermelon? (Inquiry)
*  Seller: It's 15NT per kilogram (Offer/quotation)
*  Buyer: Give me this one. (Order)


NO PLAGIARISM!
