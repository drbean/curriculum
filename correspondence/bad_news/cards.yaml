        * Bad-news

        Make up the reasons for failing the student. They could be related to homework, classroom behavior, attitude, attendance, etc.

        Make up a solution/alternative for the student. They could be repeating the class next year, dropping out of school, cleaning the school, apologizing to the teacher (!), etc.
