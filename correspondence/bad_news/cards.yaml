        * Situation
        * Bad-news
        * Alternative/solution
        * Forward-looking close

        Make up the reasons for failing the student. They could be related to homework, classroom behavior, attitude, attendance, etc.

        Make up a solution/alternative for the student. They could be repeating the class next year, dropping out of school, cleaning the school, apologizing to the teacher (!), etc.
    
        There is no need for To:, From:, Subject:, etc lines.

        You are a teacher at NUU. Instead of just reporting a failing midterm grade of below 60, the school wants you to submit a formal bad-news letter to students who do badly in the exam, informing them they may fail the course if they don't start working harder. Use the format in the book on page 92 to write a letter for bad boy, Rong Tramp.

        * Situation
        * Bad-news
        * Alternative/solution
        * Forward-looking close

        Use one or more of the 4 approaches to negative messages on page 86.

            - 1. Choose the positive, avoid the negative
            - 2. Give clear reasons and explanations
            - 3. Use conditional sentences and suggest hypothetical situations
            - 4. Choose vocabulary with positive connotations


        Make up a solution/alternative for the student. They could be dropping out from the class, dropping out of school, working harder, talking to the teacher (!), etc.
    
        Do these things:

        * Describe the situation, eg, the role of the midterm exam, its importance, the lack of work by Rong Tramp, etc
        * Remember the buffer word(s). "Unfortunately", "As a result", etc.
        * Give the bad news. eg "You failed the mid-term exam."
        * Make up a solution/alternative for the student. They could be dropping out from the class, dropping out of school, working harder, talking to the teacher (!), etc.
        * Try to end positively
