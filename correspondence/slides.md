B: An email to the [moodle LMS ](https://sac.nuu.edu.tw/cgi-bin/moodle) telling Dr Bean about

2. anything you want to say, or
3. what you expect from the course, or
4. all 3 of the above.

50 words

## In 2nd week

We will review the emails written for homework.

but 

## Some students said in their message they didn't understand

That means I failed.

But there are many chances to communicate remaining in the course, so we can try again.

## I don't know I failed, unless you say something

I can't read minds if the students are silent.

I understood last week you didn't understand I wanted you to say, "Is your name Greg?"

You asked free questions, rather than the question to find out my name which has the answer, "Yes."

## When should the students say something?

Afterwards on the Internet, or after the activity is over, is too late.

You should interrupt me.

Put your hand up.

Or, get a student at the front to put his/her hand up while the activity is still going on.

## When you don't understand what page of the book an exercise is about

You should say:

What page is this [exercise [on]]?

## When you don't understand what the right answer is

You should say:

What is the answer [to this [exercise]]?

## When you don't understand why the right answer is right

If you don't understand why the right answer is right, or how to get the right answer,

You should say:

Can you explain (how to get) the answer [to this [exercise]]?

## When you think your answer is not wrong, but moodle says it is wrong

You should say:

What is wrong with this answer? It looks OK to me.

## When your got the answer wrong, but you want a second chance

Can I try it again?

## When an exercise you're working on disappears or misbehaves.

You can say:

What's wrong with the exercise (which|that) I was working on?

## Seek and you shall find

Seek and you shall find. Ask and it will be given to you. (Matthew 7:7)

It's *not* the idea that you're not supposed to speak to the teacher.

It *is* the idea that you *are* supposed to speak to the teacher.

# The 8 characteristics of good business communication (8 C's)

## Clear

Means easy to understand. The reader has no doubts about what the email is trying to say, and what he/she has to do.

It does not mean distinct or anything to do with seeing (in this context.)

It does not mean definite or explicit (in this context,) although this may help the email be clear.

It is about what is in the reader's head after reading the email.

## Concise

Means short.

It does not mean not-complicated.

## Considerate

Does not mean careful, but it does mean caring for other people.

Another word for considerate is thoughtful. But this doesn't mean just thinking a lot. It means thinking a lot about other people and hoping your actions can benefit them, and trying to do that. 

Someone with EQ is probably considerate.

# Exam

The exam will cover pp 31-57 of the textbook: Memos, cover letters/emails, and Routine business transactions (promotion/introductions and inquiries)
