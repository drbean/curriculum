B: An email to the [moodle LMS ](https://sac.nuu.edu.tw/cgi-bin/moodle) telling Dr Bean about

1. yourself, or
2. anything you want to say, or
3. what you expect from the course, or
4. all 3 of the above.

50 words

## In 2nd week

We will review the emails written for homework.

but 

## Some students said in their message they didn't understand

That means I failed.

But there are many chances to communicate remaining in the course, so we can try again.

## I don't know I failed, unless you say something

I can't read minds if the students are silent.

I understood last week you didn't understand I wanted you to say, "Is your name Greg?"

You asked free questions, rather than the question to find out my name which has the answer, "Yes."

## When should the students say something?

Afterwards on the Internet, or after the activity is over, is too late.

You should interrupt me.

Put your hand up.

Or, get a student at the front to put his/her hand up while the activity is still going on.

## The End
