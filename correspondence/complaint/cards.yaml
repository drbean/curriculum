      sentence:
        - On April 27, I ordered 25 china dolls from you (order number CD 1345).
        - The dolls arrived yesterday, May 7 in a partly-opened package, which had not been properly taped.
        - As a result, all the dolls were damaged, with broken faces, or torn clothing.
        - We are extremely unhappy about this situation.
        - We want you to send us a replacement set of dolls, at your expense.
