For the most part, we have been very satisfied with the quality of the employees you have sent us to work in our warehouses.<p> However, over the last two months we have noticed a definite change in the quality of employee we have been sent. On 27 June, nine employees arrived, only one of whom lasted a week. On 11 July, six more workers were due to arrive, but only two did (and they were both late). Then, on 24 July, eighteen workers arrived who were all under the impression their duties would not involve _________ lifting, which is certainly not the case. After being told what was expected of them, thirteen left ___________.

We urgently need seventeen employees for our day shift (usual terms apply), and would appreciate getting employees who are willing to do the jobs expected of them. Employment would be on a week-to-week basis.<p>  If the quality of employees we receive is not up to our required standard, I am afraid we will be forced to consider another recruitment agency.

            <p>I am writing to complaint about the letter that I wrote to you last month. On 10 April 2017 I want to assure the building model is right so I have to discuss the details with you. However, to date, I don't receive any letter from you and any information about you. My customer and boss are angry and I break credit and damage my reputation. I don't know what happened to you.</p>
            <p>I would appreciate your informing us when we can receive your letter by May 22. Also, if letter cannot be received by the end of this month, we will be forced to look for other designer for this building model.</p>
