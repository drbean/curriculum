            <p>I am writing to complaint about the letter that I wrote to you last month. On 10 April 2017 I want to assure the building model is right so I have to discuss the details with you. However, to date, I don't receive any letter from you and any information about you. My customer and boss are angry and I break credit and damage my reputation. I don't know what happened to you.</p>
            <p>I would appreciate your informing us when we can receive your letter by May 22. Also, if letter cannot be received by the end of this month, we will be forced to look for other designer for this building model.</p>
            <p>Thank you in advance for your cooperation in this matter.</p>
