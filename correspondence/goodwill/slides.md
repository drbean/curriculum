## Homework: Thanks, congratulation or condolence

Choose one of the 3 kinds of message you want to write. Imagine the content of what you want to say.

Just 3 sentences about the one kind of message, following the structures in the book. No need for header, salutation, etc.

Put each sentence on a new line.

## Homework: an invitation letter to a prof

Imagine you are the president of the NUU students' association.

Send an invitation to an old president of the association to invite him to a party celebrating the association's 40th anniversary.

Use the information in the book, p 71.

Required are:

- To:
- From:
- Subject:

lines.

Look at the things you need to say and useful expressions on p 69.

You can start,

I am the president of the student association at NUU and I would like to invite you to a reception celebrating the 40th anniversary of the association.

You don't need to include information at the end of the exercise about what the student association plans will happen at the anniversary celebration. Just include the 3 parts on p69: the invitation, the event details, the request for a reply.

In the request for reply, say, "If you are able (or not able) to come, could you please inform us by October 30, as you need to plan for the event."

## Homework: Prof Chang replies to the invitation letter

Now take the role of Prof Chang.

Reply to the invitation last week by you, when you were the president of the NUU students' association, to a party celebrating the association's 40th anniversary.

Either accept or decline/refuse/reject the invitation.

Follow the examples of accepting or declining invitations on p 72.

Required are:

- To:
- From:
- Subject:

lines.

Look at the things you need to say and useful expressions on p 69.

You can start,

Thank you very much for the invitation to your reception celebrating the 40th anniversary of the NUU students' association.

Then, you need to say whether you're accepting or declining.

* If you're declining, include a reason why you can't go.
* If you're accepting, also say you're looking forward to going.

Then, if you're:

* declining, apologize twice.
* or accepting, say thanks again.

So, that's

* 4 things to say, if you're accepting.
* 5 things to say, if you're declining.
