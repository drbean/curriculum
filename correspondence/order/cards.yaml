      identifier: cancelling the sweater order cancellation
      rubric: |+
        The following exercise is about the sweater order on p 121,122,123 of PDF. Charlie Stevenson cancelled his order, but then he realized he made a mistake and now he wants to 'cancel his cancellation'.

        Here is what he wants to say in Chinese. Write the message for him. There is no need for headers, etc.

        * 我寫的是與9月11日生產的24件棉質毛衣的訂單SX126F_和_SX128F有關。
        * 由於棉花導致皮膚癌的報導，我於9月16日取消了此訂單。
        * 不幸的是，我誤讀了這份報告，這實際上表明棉花可以預防皮膚癌。
        * 因此，我希望取消我的訂單取消。
        * 也就是說，我希望你送我24件SX126F_和_SX128F棉質毛衣。
        * 你能否確認收到這條消息後再確認一下。
        * 我期待著在未來與您開展更多業務。
        * 對於由此造成的不便，我深表歉意。

        Follow the structure on p114, p120 of PDF. Look at the cancellation on p115, p121 of PDF.
