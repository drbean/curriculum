            I must apologize for troubling you, but a few alterations need to be made to the designs before they can be sent to the printers. However I have failed to open the file you sent me on my computer. It must be my mistake, but would it be possible for you to email it to me again in a different format.
            Thanking you, in advance. And again, my apologies.
            Yours sincerely,
