## cover email for Kendall visit

You are Tom Farrell, the chairperson of the Business Management Department. Henry Kendall, a top businessman is visiting the department. All the staff know about the visit, but they may not know much about Kendall. For their information, you send them kendall.pdf, a file with some highlights of Kendall's career.

Write the cover email for this file. It only needs to be two sentences in one paragraph, the first saying Kendall is visiting and the second like the Smart proposal, saying what you are attaching. There is no need for instructions, or to invite feedback, or questions.
