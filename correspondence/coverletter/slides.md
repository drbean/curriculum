# Homework: a cover email from your company

Imagine you have a company. Send an attachment to a customer, other company, etc.

Required are:



To: CC: From: Subject: lines

In the body only 2 sentences are necessary

Give the attached file a name, eg 

Attachment: proposal.pdf

## cover email for Kendall visit

You are Tom Farrell, the chairperson of the Business Management Department. Henry Kendall, a top businessman is visiting the department. All the staff know about the visit, but they may not know much about Kendall. For their information, you send them kendall.pdf, a file with some highlights of Kendall's career.

Write the cover email for this file. It only needs to be two sentences in one paragraph, the first saying Kendall is visiting and the second like the Smart proposal, saying what you are attaching. There is no need for instructions, or to invite feedback, or questions.

Write the To:, From, and Subject: lines. In the body, write one paragraph. At the end, write Attachment: and the name of the file.

## cover email for Flowerdew visit

In Week 12, you wrote the cover email Tom Farrell, the chairperson of the Business Management Department sent to teachers in the department about Henry Kendall, a top businessman who was visiting the department. All the staff knew about the visit, but they may not have known much about Kendall. For their information, you sent them kendall.pdf, a file with some highlights of Kendall's career.

Now, look at p 42. The situation on p 42 is different. It is confusing. IGNORE IT. You are going to write a cover letter for a simpler situation in the Language Center in which the chairperson sends teachers a file, a situation just like the one you did for homework.

You are going to substitute Tracy Cheng for Tom Farrell. Substitute the Language Center for the Business Management Department. Substitute John Flowerdew, a top linguist for Henry Kendall, a top businessman. Substitute flowerdew.pdf for kendall.pdf.

Write the cover email for this file, flowerdew.pdf. It only needs to be two sentences in one paragraph, the first saying Flowerdew is visiting and the second saying what you are attaching. There is no need for instructions, or to invite feedback, or questions.

Write the To:, From, and Subject: lines. In the body, write one paragraph. At the end, write Attachment: and the name of the file.
