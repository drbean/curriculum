        ## Supplier's promotion/introduction targetting your seller

        Last time, you wrote about a purchase you made. Now imagine a supplier had contacted the company/person which sold you the thing you bought. Like this--

        Supplier -> Seller -> You

        Imagine the supplier wanted to supply them with the thing you bought.

        Follow the structure in the book on p47 and the example on p48, but keep it short. Like this--

                We saw your address in X and wanted to know 
                if you are interested in Y (=doing something).

                We are a large Z company in A and have been 
                doing business for 50 years.

                Our B product is very popular, and C (=some 
                other things).

                Please do not hesitate to contact us if you
                are interested. We are ready to send samples
                and catalogues on your reply.

                You can contact us through our website, (=http://D)
                and our email address is E@F.

                Looking forward to hearing from you.

        You can copy and paste my example and just need to substitute for the Z~F symbols and (parenthesized comments.)

        ## No need for headers or the parts of a business letter.

      rubric: |+
        In the exam I will ask you to unscramble an introduction a Taiwan soup maker sent to a disctributor of Taiwan food products in Japan about its fresh soups in a carton, seeking their distribution in Japan.

        I want you to make a quiz question for the other students about the introduction from the Taiwan soup company.
    
        Write a sentence from the email the Taiwan company sent the Japanese company as the question. Make the options:

        - step 1a. source of reader's email address
        - step 1b. aim of message
        - step 2. description of the soup company
        - step 3. selling points of the fresh soup in a carton, not a can
        - step 4. call to action
        
        Then do the quizzes of the other students.

        Very good questions I will also put in the exam.
