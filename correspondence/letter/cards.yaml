        - question: The reason it is a good idea to write out the month, eg January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, October, November, December, rather than to write 1 .. 12.
          option:
            - English speakers like to see the name of the month
            - Foreigners might not know the name of the month in English
            - It takes longer to write out the month
            - The same expression may mean different dates to different people
            - US dates are written with the month before the day/date
          answer: The same expression may mean different dates to different people
