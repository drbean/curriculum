            Use grammar to show attitudes. Say, "We are unable to deliver before next week," not "Delivery will not be possible before next week." Avoiding use of "we" as the subject will be taken as an attempt to escape responsibility and will not be appreciated. Thus not, "10 workers will be laid off," but "We will lay off 10 workers."

           - Be natural
