## Homework: an inquiry letter from your company

Imagine you have a company. Send an inquiry to another company about goods or services you need for your own business.

Or you can start with the structure and expressions provided in the book with 4 steps.

Required are:

## Homework: an inquiry letter about a Taiwan cruise.

Write the email to the cruise company. Include To:, From:, Subject: and Date: (it will be July31 or another date early in August)

Use the information given in the book. For the first question, you need to say what your partner's dietary requirements are (Is he/she allergic to some food (what food?). Is he/she a vegetarian? You decide.) For the second and third question, you just have to change "you" to "I/me", etc.

Dietary requirements: For example is your partner French, and will they only eat French food? Or, does your partner only eat one meal a day, after midnight?

Do it before Sunday March 6, 8pm.
