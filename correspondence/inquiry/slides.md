# Homework: an inquiry letter from your company

Imagine you have a company. Send an inquiry to another company about goods or services you need for your own business.

You can follow the example of the Lady Golfer inquiry, but use your details, not theirs.

Or you can start with the structure and expressions provided in the book with 4 steps.

Required are:

- Letterhead
- Date
- Inside address
- Body
- Complimentary close
- Sender's name and position
