      sentence: Dear Sir or Madam, <p> I am writing to inquire about women's golf clubs. I saw your advertisement in the January issue of Women's Golf, and am interested in the clubs you featured there. I have a number of golf stores in Taiwan, where women's golf is seeing an explosion in popularity, and am interested in stocking a number of your irons and woods, because sources for golf equipment for women are hard to find. <p> Could you please send me your catalogue, with prices and terms. I would appreciate receiving it by January 21, as my stocks are running low. <p> I look forward to hearing from you.
