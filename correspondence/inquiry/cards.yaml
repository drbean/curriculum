    confusion:
      identifier: The difference between promotion/introduction and an inquiry
      questiontext: |+
        The key difference is

        a promoter: you want to *sell* something, so you contact someone who may *buy*

        a person with an inquiry: you are thinking of *buying* something. You ask a *seller* for information.

        Another difference is who has information and who has questions about information

        a promoter: you have *information* about something you sell and you want to *give* it to someone who may buy
    
        a person with an inquiry: you want *information* before buying something. You *ask* a seller for that information.

I have a number of golf stores in Taiwan, where women's golf is seeing an explosion in popularity, and I wish to stock a number of your irons and woods, because sources for golf equipment for women are hard to find. <p> Could you please send me your catalogue, with prices and terms.

            Dear Terry:

            I am writing to enquire if you could tell me about the
            information of this trip advertised in the Taipei Times. I am worried that our trip can't
            go well.

            The first question is about the food on the ship. My wife has the gout, so she can't eat the foods which have high cholesterol.

            Second is my friends are also interested in this cruise, but they can't go with us because they have to work on the date. Therefore, I want to know if this kind of cruise may be repeated.

            At last, I am not good at swimming. Is it OK?

            We would be thankful if you can reply in this week.

            I look forward to hearing from you.

            Yours faithfully,

            My husband has very strict dietary requirements. He is 
            Muslim and doesn't eat pork. so I am very worried the 
            food on the ship will not be suitable.

            My friends are also interested in this cruise, but are
            unable to go on the data in the advertisement. I am
            wondering if this kind of cruise may be repeated.

            problem.

            Taiwanese. He need to eats 4 meals a day
            (breakfast,lunch,dinner and late night supper).  He must
            have white rice at every meal, except for breakfast to
            bread and milk.  And don't serve too much for lunch, dinner
            and late night supper.  Because of allergie, please do not
            include seafood and peanuts in meals.

            And my friends are also interested in this cruise, but are

            I am writing to enquire about details of the meals on the ship in the cruise I saw your advertising on the booking website. I and my partner are both interested, but my partner has some strict dietary requirements.

            My partner is allergic to seafood. So I wonder if there are any meals on the ship besides seafood. I would appreciate it if you could send me your menu.

            My friends also interested in this cruise, but are unable to go on the date in the advertisement. I am wondering if this kind of cruise may be repeated.

            Besides that I am not a strong swimmer. I am wondering if this is a problem.

            Regarding the above questions, please tell me in detail. I am looking forward to your reply.

            Yours sincerely,
