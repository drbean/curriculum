        ## cruise inquiry

        Write the cruise inquiry described on p. 58. Follow the structure described on p. 53, 54.
        
        Write the To:, From, Subject: and Date: lines, but there is no need for email addresses. The Date will be July31 or another date early in August.

        In the body, write five (5) short paragraphs, one for the opening, one for each of the concerns you have, and one for the closing.
    
        Use the information in the book. You only need to use your imagination for your partner's dietary requirements.
        
        For the first question, you need to say what your partner's dietary requirements are (Is he/she allergic to some food (what food?). Is he/she a vegetarian? You decide.) For the second and third question, you just have to change "you" to "I/me", etc.

        Dietary requirements: For example is your partner French, and will they only eat French food? Or, does your partner only eat one meal a day, after midnight?
