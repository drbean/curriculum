# Tone

## What is tone?

The way you say things

- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_communication ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_communication)


culture

## emphasis

An example of its own advice. It's doing what it's saying.

	Emphasized: 1st paragraph/sentence
	Subordinated: Middle paragraphs/sentences
	Emphasized: last paragraph/sentence

## confidence

	Don't be humble
	Be confident, aggressive

But don't be arrogrant, or presumptuous. That antagonizes the reader.

I wish the students would ask questions.
