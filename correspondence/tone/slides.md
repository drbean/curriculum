# Tone

## What is tone?

The way you say things

- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_communication ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_communication)


culture

## emphasis

An example of its own advice. It's doing what it's saying.

	Emphasized: 1st paragraph/sentence
	Subordinated: Middle paragraphs/sentences
	Emphasized: last paragraph/sentence

## confidence

	Don't be humble
	Be confident, aggressive

But don't be arrogrant, or presumptuous. That antagonizes the reader.

I wish the students would ask questions.

# Improving the tone

Look at the 4 approaches on 10-2

1. Choose the positive, avoid the negative
2. Give clear reasons and explanations
3. Use conditional sentences and suggest hypothetical situations
4. Choose vocabulary with positive connotations

And the 5 points of 10-3

- Help with a problem. Don't say the reader is doing it wrong.
- Say what you can do, not what you can't do.
- Don't criticize or blame the reader. Focus on the situation, not the people.
- Acknowledge your own mistakes.
- Be grateful attempts have been made, even if they are unsuccessful.
