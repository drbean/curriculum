# 2 emails

## Work is stressful.

Don't put more pressure on the people you talk to. One of these 2 emails is impolite and would be stressful for the reader.

## one

I got the email. Send me your catalogue.

Your price is too high.
But, send me 10 boxes of LED lights, No 3425.

We expect the order to be sent today.

Don't make a mistake with the order.

## two

Thank you for your email. Please send me your catalog.

We think your prices are rather high.
But, could you send me 10 boxes of LED lights, No 3425.

We hope you can send the order as soon as possible.

# Strategies for improving tone

## 1. confidence

	Don't be humble
	Be confident, aggressive

But don't be arrogrant, or presumptuous. That antagonizes the reader.

I wish the students would ask questions.

## 2. courteous & sincere, passive

Think about avoiding responsibility.

## 3. emphasis

### emphasis paragraphs

The following 3 questions are about emphasis and subordination.

Read the following essay:

In a three-paragraph essay, some ideas are remembered by readers, and others aren't. Writers are aware of this and use emphasis and subordination to control what makes an impression on the reader and what doesn't.

Writers emphasize ideas by placing them in the first paragraph. These ideas are remembered best. They also emphasize ideas by placing them in the last paragraph. These ideas are also remembered well.

Ideas placed in middle paragraphs don't make much of an impression. They are subordinated or in the background, by being placed in middle paragraphs.

An example of its own advice. It's doing what it's saying.

	Emphasized: 1st paragraph/sentence
	Subordinated: Middle paragraphs/sentences
	Emphasized: last paragraph/sentence

### emphasis explanation

You can help your readers understand which of your ideas you consider most important by using emphasis and subordination (background information).

Ideas placed in the first paragraph of a document receive the most emphasis, followed by information placed in the last paragraph.

You can subordinate an idea (put it in the background) by placing it in middle paragraphs of your message, because these paragraphs receive the least emphasis.

### 3 (5) typographical emphasis

# Homework

## Improving the tone

Rewrite the 4 sentences on p93 to make them less negative, less unwelcome, without changing the meaning.

Don't APOLOGIZE. Use good expressions to make a good impression.

Look at the 4 approaches on 10-2, p86

1. Choose the positive, avoid the negative
2. Give clear reasons and explanations
3. Use conditional sentences and suggest hypothetical situations
4. Choose vocabulary with positive connotations

And the 5 points (or guidelines) of 10-3, p90

- Help with a problem. Don't say the reader is doing it wrong.
- Say what you can do, not what you can't do.
- Don't criticize or blame the reader. Focus on the situation, not the people.
- Acknowledge your own mistakes.
- Be grateful attempts have been made, even if they are unsuccessful.

## Homework: the problem of tone

Tone is how you say things. The effect on people of what you say depends on how you say it.

- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_communication ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonverbal_communication)

I want you to show some awareness of tone.

Take a message (1-2 lines) you found somewhere or wrote yourself.

Talk about the effect of the message on people.

Say how the effect could be made different if a different tone were used.

For example,

	A teacher says to a student, "Out! Get out!"
	The teacher feels bad. The student feels bad.

	The teacher could say, "Kindly leave the room."
	The teacher is more polite. The student feels less bad.

Or,
	
	Chen says, "I feel honored by your invitation."
	Shaw feels good, even though Chen doesn't mean it. Chen is polite.

	Chen could say, "I don't want to speak at your symposium."
	Shaw feels bad, even though Chen is speaking the truth.

## Homework: the use of passives in tone

Look at the exercise, _use of passive_, at:

- [https://sac.nuu.edu.tw/cgi-bin/moodle/mod/quiz/attempt.php?attempt=183618&cmid=4121 ](https://sac.nuu.edu.tw/cgi-bin/moodle/mod/quiz/attempt.php?attempt=183618&cmid=4121)

Think about the options:

* a. Emphasizes what is important is the object of action, or action itself
* b. Is more diplomatic (make reader feel less bad)
* c. Avoids blaming the person who took the action
* d. The person who took the action is unknown
* e. It's not important who took the action

Find or write a sentence that uses a passive to set the tone. Choose one of the descriptions and add it to the sentence.

Like,

	"I am honored by your invitation"
	Emphasizes what is important is the action and the object of the action
