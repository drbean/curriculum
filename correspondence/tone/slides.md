# Tone

## What is tone?

The way you say things

## 2 emails

Work is stressful. Don't put more pressure on the people you talk to. One of these 2 emails is impolite and would be stressful for the reader.

### one

I got the email. Send me your catalogue.

Your price is too high.
But, send me 10 boxes of LED lights, No 3425.

We expect the order to be sent today.

Don't make a mistake with the order.

### two

Thank you for your email. Please send me your catalog.

We think your prices are rather high.
But, could you send me 10 boxes of LED lights, No 3425.

We hope you can send the order as soon as possible.

## courteous & sincere, passive

Think about avoiding responsibility.

## emphasis

An example of its own advice. It's doing what it's saying.

	Emphasized: 1st paragraph/sentence
	Subordinated: Middle paragraphs/sentences
	Emphasized: last paragraph/sentence

### emphasis explanation

You can help your readers understand which of your ideas you consider most important by using emphasis and subordination (background information).

Ideas placed in the first paragraph of a document receive the most emphasis, followed by information placed in the last paragraph.

You can subordinate an idea (put it in the background) by placing it in middle paragraphs of your message, because these paragraphs receive the least emphasis.

### emphasis paragraphs

The following 3 questions are about emphasis and subordination.

Read the following essay:

In a three-paragraph essay, some ideas are remembered by readers, and others aren't. Writers are aware of this and use emphasis and subordination to control what makes an impression on the reader and what doesn't.

Writers emphasize ideas by placing them in the first paragraph. These ideas are remembered best. They also emphasize ideas by placing them in the last paragraph. These ideas are also remembered well.

Ideas placed in middle paragraphs don't make much of an impression. They are subordinated or in the background, by being placed in middle paragraphs.

## confidence

	Don't be humble
	Be confident, aggressive

But don't be arrogrant, or presumptuous. That antagonizes the reader.

I wish the students would ask questions.

# Homework

# Improving the tone

Look at the 4 approaches on 10-2

1. Choose the positive, avoid the negative
2. Give clear reasons and explanations
3. Use conditional sentences and suggest hypothetical situations
4. Choose vocabulary with positive connotations

And the 5 points of 10-3

- Help with a problem. Don't say the reader is doing it wrong.
- Say what you can do, not what you can't do.
- Don't criticize or blame the reader. Focus on the situation, not the people.
- Acknowledge your own mistakes.
- Be grateful attempts have been made, even if they are unsuccessful.
