# Good will and good news messages

The difference is goodwill messages are about relationships between people. Good news messages tell some one they are getting money.

# Homework

## Homework: Cheng's reply to Keat's transfer request

Keats (p78) is not happy, but the reply to him is good news.

Give the good news in the one-sentence first paragraph.

In the second paragraph, copy the sentences from the book, changing "he, his" to "you, your".

In the one-sentence third paragraph, wish him well at the office in Taichung.

You don't need to mention his mother. It is not the company's concern.

### Points to note: Be careful of the following mistakes, which will cost you.

	- Too similar to another's work.
	- You say 'Congratulations', or "I'm proud of you", only when the person you are congratulating already has the good news, and it was given to them by someone else, not you.
	- 'We would like to approve your request' means we cannot approve it.
	- 'We will allow your request' sounds unfriendly, as if Keats should not be asking for the transfer, but the company will let him go anyway.
	- 'I would tell you' ??? You mean, 'I am pleased to tell you'
	- Not "You will be pleased to hear ..". "I am pleased to tell you .."
	- Not "I hear your request has been accepted" or "The boss says your request has been accepted". No. Manager Cheng is  representing the company and is making an official company statement. "The company has accepted your request."
	- Not "I want to tell you good news", or "I have good news". Just say "Your request has been approved" straight away.

# Exam

## Google scam spam

Your boss, a criminal, wants you to write an email which says the reader is the winner of one million dollars in a Google lottery. The reader is not really going to get any money.

The aim of the email is to get the reader to send his/her credit card number and password.

Write the email. Follow the 3- or 4-paragraph structure in the book.
