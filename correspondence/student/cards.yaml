      questiontext: |+
        How can you tell if someone is sincere? You can't.

        So Dr Bean's decisions that the thoughts of some students were not sincerely felt are without basis.

        He thinks that if someone expressed themselves smoothly and wrote a lot, they were probably _not_ being sincere. And if they wrote simply, or didn't write very much, or didn't express themselves very well, they probably _were_ being sincere.

        In fact, the less sincere Dr Bean felt you were, the higher the goodwill homework score he probably gave you!

      questiontext: |+
        The Information Management majors take this class on Friday, so there is a different deadline for the homework for them, not Sunday 2pm but the next Friday 8am. However, I often forget to set that different deadline, so they sometimes find in the middle of the week they can't submit the homework.

        Last week, on Sunday, Monday and Thursday, some of those students sent me messages asking me to open the homework, but I ignored them. I mistakenly thought they were students in my Monday class. If I had looked at their ID numbers, I would have realized they were in my Friday class. But, also, if their messages had contained more background information I would have realized what the problem was.
    
        Which of the parts of the complaint message were a problem or were missing?
