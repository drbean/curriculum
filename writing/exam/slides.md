# Exam

## Exam 1 of 4--Writing in class

Write 150 words about each topic. 

* Dear diary--what happened since your last diary entry 
* Johari--who is the person that is me?

### Dear diary--what happened since your last diary entry?

You wrote the diary entry last week, perhaps. Now write about what happened this week. Use the past tense. Don't say, "My family is my greatest support." Say, "Mom and Dad made me feel better on Thursday."

### Johari window

Analyze your personality. What kind of person are you? It is difficult to know yourself. Try to use the Johari window to think about who you are. I want to see the 4 phrases, "open self", "hidden self", "blind self" and "unknown self" in the essay.

For each topic: At the top of each page, write the titles, "Diary", or "Johari."

Below the title, before you start writing, write notes. Chinese notes are OK. If there are no notes, your grade goes down.
