# Exam

## Exam 1 of 4--Writing in class

Write 150 words about each topic. 

* Dear diary--what happened since your last diary entry 
* Johari--who is the person that is me?

### Dear diary--what happened since your last diary entry?

You wrote the diary entry last week, perhaps. Now write about what happened this week. Use the past tense. Don't say, "My family is my greatest support." Say, "Mom and Dad made me feel better on Thursday."

### Johari window

Analyze your personality. What kind of person are you? It is difficult to know yourself. Try to use the Johari window to think about who you are. I want to see the 4 phrases, "open self", "hidden self", "blind self" and "unknown self" in the essay.

For each topic: At the top of each page, write the titles, "Diary", or "Johari."

Below the title, before you start writing, write notes. Chinese notes are OK. If there are no notes, your grade goes down.

Midterm exam
Choose 2 of 3 topics. Write 150 words about each topic. 

* Who am I? What do I know/not know about myself and what can I tell you?
* My foreign-language-speaking self
* A good judge of character helps own family consider selves

* Who am I? What do I know/not know about myself and what can I tell you?
You wrote a self introduction. Tell us what kind of person you are. Tell us what you think about yourself.
Tell us what your friends/family think about you.

* My new foreign-language-speaking self
Your personality changes when you speak a different language in real life.
Tell us what kind of person you would be if you went to live in a different country and spoke a different language.
Tell us how you would be different in the other language, and how you would be similar to how you are now.

* A good judge of character helps own family consider selves
You told a friend what her good points and bad points are. Now evaluate your family and other friends.
Not what you like/dislike about them, but what they can be proud of, and what they (should) wish to change about themselves.

For each topic: At the top of each page, write the titles listed above. 

Below the title, before you start writing, write notes. Chinese notes are OK. If there are no notes, your grade goes down.

Halfway through we will write questions on another person's exam paper. The writer will edit their essay to incorporate their reader's answer to the question.

Write on every second line, ie double space. I want you to use the space to edit your essay later.
