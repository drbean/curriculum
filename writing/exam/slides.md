## Exam 1

Exam 1 of 4--Writing in class
Choose 2 of 3 topics. Write 150 words about each topic. 

* Winter vacation plans--what you will do January, February 
* Dear diary--what happened since your last diary entry 
* Gratitude journal--remembering things you are thankful for 

* Winter vacation plans--what you will do January, February 

You wrote about what you did in the summer vacation. Now write about what you will do during the winter one. 
Don't answer these questions but think about: 
1. What you plan to do 
2. What is plan B? What will you do if plan A fails? 
3. What you expect to look back at with satisfaction 
4. What you expect to regret 
5. What you expect to learn 

* Dear diary--what happened since your last diary entry 
You wrote the diary entry last night, perhaps. Now write about what happened this morning. If you wrote it on Monday night, what happened on Tuesday. If you didn't write a diary entry, write about what happened some time in the last week.

* Gratitude journal--remembering things you are thankful for
See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gratitude_journal and http://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/tips_for_keeping_a_gratitude_journal. 

5 things which happened in the last week which you are thankful for. Why did they happen, and why are you thankful for them? Write 30 words about each thing. 

For each topic: At the top of each page, write the titles listed above. 

Below the title, before you start writing, write notes. Chinese notes are OK. If there are no notes, your grade goes down.
