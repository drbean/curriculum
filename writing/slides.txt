     *Opinion and survey about Education and NUU.
          *The best way to learn English

     Opinion: Why this is an important question?
     Ans: Of course this is an important question. First, we know that
     English is a universal language that used by every country in
     every side.  So that's why we need to learn English and what is
     the best way to learn English?










     There's a lot of way to improve our English skill. Start from the
     easiest way, you need to read an English subject or topic like
     reading an English books at least 10-15 minutes every day. When
     your reading skill is getting better, you will enjoy to reading
     English.













     The other way is try to listening to English music, try to sing
     it out, it's a lot of fun studying English by music. You can also
     watch English movies, although it's little harder, but I suggest
     better do the first and the second way. Both of them are kind of
     fun an best way to improve your English.














                                Jill

     What is the best way to improving our English?













     Intro

     All of us know that English is a very important language, it help
     us to connect with the whole world, whatever you major in.
     Supposing that English is not your mother tongue, what should we
     do? To take lessons after school? Or to have self-study would
     be better?












                               Writing

                             by Dr Bean

                     (hint: press the spacebar)












     Method

     I think the best way to improve English is stying in an
     English-speaking Countries.  But usually we don't have enough
     resources to support us. So the best way is to join in a
     conversation class. To discuss news, books, life, different
     cultures etc. that  something will force me to
     read.







     Lolly said: I was torment with some words that just recited by
     heart. Recently I     started reading China Post. First, you will
     meet lots of words you seem to recited   before, but can't
     remember what they are means. Do not check on the dictionary at
     once, you should read the context, to associate with one word in
     thinking. After     reading the whole writings, on this moment
     you can check on the dictionary, than you can keep this word in
     mind. While the word appears again and again, you should not
     forget it
     anyhow.

     >From Mr. Y, he's a music lover, often reads English magazines on
     music, finds out   words he can't read it. "Listening Western
     music, " he said, there are lots of spoken + languages in words
     of songs. If you need more formal or professional, you'd better
     to + read a book.







     Result

     Everybody has their own ways to learn English. Someone are forced
     to learn, others ar +e willing to learn. Ways of learning comes
     from the Internet or from senior people.













     Conclusion

     Not only learning languages, learning a new thing always needs
     fun, so that we can do + it more longer. Once you find joy in
     something you have learn, I think that's the    first step toward
     success.

              The size of school restaurant

       Every lunch time when i get into school restaurant,i see all
     the seats are seated a +nd air is so smelly especially in
     summer.Furthurmore,there are few meal for me to choo -se.Because
     of these problems,i have a questionâ  For the quality of our
     mealtime and space for eating,how could we improve our restaurant?â  








       To solve this problem,there are several ways which are from my
     friends opinions.  First of all,my classmate,Paul,said that he
     didnâ  t care about the size of the resta ur+ant, but he did care
     about the meal choices of the restaurant.So he advised to have
     more vendor in our school.Second,my friend,Monica,thought the
     best way to solve this pr- oblem is to build a new building
     called No.2 studentâ  s restaurant.Third,my colleague,said that the
     â  BAJAâ  is the best way to improve our problem.









     In my opinion,Paulâ  s advice is not suitable for most of students
     because he lives i+n dormitory,he doesnâ  t have to care about the
     quality of the restaurant.So i think it i+s not the best
     way.Additionally,my thoughts to Monica is that it will cost too
     much m- oney to build a new building and there is no more space
     to build.Moreover,the third advice is the shorttest one but the
     most efficiency one.Move to â  BAJAâ   is definit ly the best way to
     solve this problem because the place is bigger and the quality of
     the + restaurant will evacuate.







                              t9733053

                  Exam Week 4, 9  Writing in class

     The opinion survey about NUU and education, rewritten

     DO NOT use notes, dictionaries, books
     DO talk to each other
     DO use other classmates, teacher's knowledge
     DO read each others' essays
     DO write in your NOTEBOOK
     DO double space your writing

     Americans don't like white-out fluid, especially on hand-written
     essays.

     Crossing out, additions are exciting to me.
     White-out puts a false face on your work.

     At 8:55 and 9:30, We will STAND UP, LEAVE our ESSAY on the desk
     and WALK AROUND and LOOK at other students' essays.

     PICK them UP and READ them.

     The exams are only worth 20 percent of the grade
     The homework is worth 60 percent

      A story about education and/or NUU

     Better than a great opinion survey and not writing a story at all
     is writing a so-so opinion survey and a so-so story.

     I will average the grade for the 2 essays, so better than
     5+0/2 is 3+3/2.







                         Exam content Week 9
      I. A rewrite of an IMRD essay of Weeks 5-8 about an
                                investigation of city life
        * With a mindmap: your ideas before you write with
        links between connected ideas.

      II. A REAL story of something new you tried, something that was risky
          Try to write it so that it has a climax, and is
          exciting to read.
        * Are you going to be successful, or are you going
                to fail?
        * What is success? What is failure?
        * A story of failure is probably more interesting
                than one of success.
        * Why was it a failure, if it failed?




                        Exam content Week 13
      I. A rewrite of an IMRD essay of Weeks 9-12 about an
     investigation of a money-related idea that you did
        * With a mindmap: your ideas before you write with
        links between connected ideas.

      II. NOT A REAL story of something new you tried, something that was risky
        Instead: A RESEARCH GRANT PROPOSAL

       Like professors here with the NSC, imagine some rich person
       or organization wants to give you money to carry out a project
       that interests you. They want to give you money, but they
       also expects some results. The results might be personal
       learning for just yourself, or they might be results with
       social benefits.

       The benefactor wants to know if giving you the money will
       results in benefits or not. If it won't, then they won't give
       you the money.

       The grant proposal is very similar to an IMRD essay, so use
       the IMRD format. But you don't have the results, because you
       haven't carried out your idea yet.

       However you can imagine what RESULTS you will get, and you can
       decide how you will EVALUATE, JUDGE the results. What will be success?
       What will be failure?

       You should say what may be learned from the project in a
       CONCLUSION.

       In the INTRODUCTION, think of these questions.

       * Is the proposal clear and easy to understand?
       * Is it a research problem (something new), or is it just
        doing something you already know about?
       * Is it an important problem, whose solution will have useful
         effects?
       * Is money necessary to solve the problem, or can it be done
        without money?
       * Do the proposers have a good idea on which to base their work?
       * Does the proposal explain clearly what work will be done?
       * Do the proposers know about the work that
         others have done on the problem?
       * Do the proposers have a track record of doing similar work?

     Shortcomings:

          * It is not clear what problem the proposal is talking about.
          * The question/problem is not well expressed.
          * It is not clear why the question is worth asking.
          * The proposal is not about something new. It's just a
             routine application of known techniques.
          * There is no evidence that the proposers will succeed where others
            have failed.
               + "We have an idea".
               + "We have a good track record".
          * A new idea is claimed but there are no details of how the
            idea is going to be carried out.
          * The proposers seem unaware of related research.
          * The proposed research has already been done.
          * The proposal is badly presented, or incomprehensible.
          * The proposers seem to be attempting too much.
          * The proposal is too expensive for the probable gain.
          * The proposers institution should be funding it.

                 Exploring the neighborhood (Annie)

     Introdution:
     I think keeping good neighborhood is an important
     thing in our life. Because sometimes you will need
     others help. So you need to know about your
     neighborhood.
     ... I hope I can get along with them friendly.

     Method:
     First, I must know who are they? What do they do?
     How long do they live here? Which floor do they
     live? How many people in their home? Second, I
     should told them who am I. ....And hope we can
     help each other.

     Result:
     One day I finished my class, and I came into my
     home, I saw my neighbor next to me. And she looks
     friendly. So I said hello to her and chat with
     her. She is nice and kind. She knew I am a
     student, so she said if I want to eat home-made
     food, I can go to there to join their dinner.

     She certainly welcomes me. After I hear that, Iâ  m
     so happy! Because I hear my classmate said that
     she has a bad neighbor. ...

     Sometimes I finish my class late and I canâ  t catch
     the garbage car, my neighbor will help me to throw
     them.

     Discussion:
     After this event, I think I will live here until I
     graduate. I certainly realize that to go out can
     rely on friendã   live outsides can rely on
     neighbor!!

                       Walking to school (May)

     I always ride the motorcycle to the school to have
     a class usually, though will not be too far from
     place that I live now to school, it probably only
     costs 50 minutes to the school..

     One day, because I have finished class, going back
     by motorcycle, then I meet one's own classmate on
     the road, I see him walk home, I think he don't
     have transportation, it is has to go home on foot
     to have no alternative. But, I ride to by him and
     stop to ask whether he needed to hitchhike, he
     answered me ...

      Can you guess what he said?

      Method/
     There is it, I think the weather is quite sunny,
     and I have enough time, do not have something
     urgent, have an hour in class period, while going
     out, I plan to try to go to the school by walking,
     because the residence position is relatively high,
     it will pass a section of downhill paths to get
     before the school, so this road will not be too
     difficult, in this distance. I find that go to
     school on foot there are a lot of junior school
     students and high school students.


     Result/
     During the process of going to school, though very
     smooth, have not had some difficulties, and let my
     mood of morning be quite good, but after I am in
     the school finish course for a whole day, being
     all tired when already analogous to the body and
     minding, I just want to come back home and have a
     good rest quickly in the mind, ...

      Can you guess what happened next?

      Discuision/
     It is a quite relaxed and simple stroll sport to
     in fact get to the school on foot in the morning,
     beneficial ...

      What will the conclusion be.

     ... it is actually a good choice to be even and
     get to the school on foot.

               Subject: U9534040: Having a phone call

     Intro

     Tomb Sweeping Festival is a day that Chinese
     people go back home to do memorial service to
     their ancestry. In the cause of this day, schools
     and companies usually have some vacations around
     April fifth, ....

     Guess what Jill said next.

      so that people can have their family
     reunion, and I will come back to  Kaohsiung in
     these days.

     Method

     This year, April fifth is happening to Monday,
     therefore some universities and companies will
     going to have one more holiday after Tomb Sweeping
     Festival, so that people don't have to return to
     their working position in a hurry. But NUU only
     have one holiday for Tomb Sweeping Festival this
     year,

     Guess what Jill said next.

      so I have no choice but to back to school in
     that day. Therefore, I had a phone call to my
     mother asking if we can advance the date to visit
     a tomb.

     Result

     My mother told me because of Tomb Sweeping
     Festival is just on Monday, a lot of people have
     to work on the next day, so that is no problem to
     visit a tomb ahead of time.

     Guess what Jill said next. I don't think you can.


      After that, we chat about things on her
     business. It seems that there will be a new
     manager to come in her office, we a little
     discussed about that. And my brother studying in
     the freshman year is caring about how
     he looks again.

     At last, thought there are lots of things that we
     can talk, worry about the cell phone fees will go
     beyond the budget, so we decided to talk more talk
     in the term I back home.

     Conclusion

     Guess what Jill said next.

      Because the object of a talk is a close family, I
     can say no matter what topics of conversation
     relaxedly. It really good to have someone I can
     share slight matters with.

              Subject: 03/26 week 6's homework (Annie)

     Making a telephone

     Introï¼ 

             Thanks to technologyâ  s progress, there are
     many ways to communicate with other people now.
     For example, we write e-mail instead of
     traditional letters, and now we have a lot of ways
     to make a phone call. Such as domestic telephone
     mobile phone or we can make a phone call on the
     internet, like MSNã  skypeâ ¦and so on.

     Guess what Annie said next.


      We donâ  t have to care the problem about
     distance.So, if I have leisure time, I will use
     skype to phone my relatives who live in America.
     Itâ  s not only free but also convenient.

     Methodï¼ 
             To make this call, I just want to know how
     do they do? How about the weather? Itâ  s there
     hot? Will they come back to Taiwan? Do they have
     any interesting things lately?

     Resultï¼ 
             Yesterday, I used skype to phone my
     relatives, and my cousin answered the phone. She
     told me they are fine. And there are not as hot as
     the weather in summer. She told me that they both
     miss my family. And she is too impatient to wait
     for coming back. She misses Taiwanâ  s night market
     and foods.

     Guess what Annie's cousin said next.


       By the way, s he asked me when will I
     go to America that if I have my spare time. I told
     her if I have enough money and enough time, I will
     go there right away!

     Discussionï¼ 

     Guess what Annie said next.


      The internet phone like â  skypeâ  , I think it is
     very useful! We can use it to mak e a call in not
     only the same country but also different country.
     And itâ  s fine that you can use it how long you
     want. Most importantly, itâ  s free!! We can sa ve a
     lot of money and maintain good relatives each
     other. I want to thanks the person who invented
     internet phone and not collect fees.

               H F Cheng's paper on teacher education

     Method

     Participants were twenty-one elementary in-service teachers, pursing an
     English teacher certificate offered by the researcher{\textquoteright}s
     university. They were required to take ten two-credit courses, each of
     which lasted for 36 hours. The data came from one of the courses,
     designing English learning activities and materials, taught by the
     researcher. The course requirement asked teachers to conduct a
     small-scale project about their own learning to teach children to learn
     with implementing one type of learning activities introduced in the
     course, information gap activities.


     In the training course, the group met every Saturday afternoon for four
     hours. The course lasted for nine weeks. At the beginning of the
     course, they were first guided by the researcher to design information
     gap activities in a four-hour workshop. Sample activity sheets were
     also used to guide the teachers to practice doing the task. Language
     learning principles and design tips were included in the workshop.
     Next, they were allowed for two weeks to design their first individual
     information gap worksheets based on a chosen lesson from a textbook
     their students were using. Later, they discussed with peers and the
     researcher about their activity sheets in a two-hour session.

     To better understand teachers{\textquoteright} opinions about
     participating in this learning community, a questionnaire was designed
     to collect data from the teachers (see Appendix 1). For this present
     study, ten statements regarding the purpose of this study were used for
     data analysis. All items asked the participants to indicate their
     responses from strongly agree to strongly disagree with each of the
     statements,

     Results

     Quantitative data regarding how teachers have learned to teach with
     the theory of incorporating information gap activities in their
     teaching are first presented in Table 1, showing the means of
     teachers{\textquoteright} responses to Item 1, 2, and 8. The mean of
     Item 1 is 2.1, which means at the beginning of attending this training
     course, the participants did not know how to use information gap
     activities in English teaching. After the researcher further examined
     percentage of teachers{\textquoteright} responses, only 16.7\% of the
     teachers checked they knew about this type of activity. The means of
     Item 2 and Item 8 are 4.2 and 4.5. Examining the data further, the
     researcher first found 89\% of the participants indicated that they
     strongly agreed and agreed that they could design the information gap
     well after taking this course and engaging in their teaching inquiry.
     Second, according to Item 8, all of the participants knew how to
     incorporate them in their teaching activities---the percentage of



                         Method and results

     An experiment that has risk:
      What is success?
      What is failure?
      How do you/we know whether it was a success or failture?
      How will you evaluate/judge what happened?

     A lesson for the writer/reader:
      What is learned?






                               Travel

     Method

     I am under the impression that a short trip can make
     your day life more happier and more fascinating. One of
     month can plane a trip scheme about 2 days or 3 days.
     And do not go away too far for your trip what is just
     about you can take a train without driving a
     car.Because of driving will be your encumbrance and
     make you tired out to enjoy your trip.

     Result

     At first I always ride my motorcycle to go out and just
     play in Miaoli. Then I always take a train to trip to
     others place. For example, Taichung or Hsinchu. Now I
     just like to carry some books and my mp3 to go to find
     a good tea bar and waste my Sunday afternoon.
     Sometimes I will just go out to play tennis with my
     friends and spend all day night to watch DVD.

                               Museum

     Method

     First thing I had to do is to watch the website of the
     museum to inquire about the museum hours and how to
     get to the museum. Second, I prepared some information
     I have to collect that those will be used in my report.

     Result

     Between walking around the museum, there were many
     children studying in elementary school are about to
     start their field trip at the same, it makes the quiet
     museum become more lively. I saw one of a boy stood in
     front of a paint he thought it's very interesting,
     bring out his notebook and than started drawing that
     paint in it. After doing that, he shared to his friends
     and they all laughed. What a warm and interesting
     moment!

     There is one thing I was ignored till time to go home.
     Outside of the main building, many kind of aquatics
     were grown in a ditch, and fishes in it. National
     Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts has green grassland with
     some work of art on it, I think families living nearby
     are surely walk on the green grass on holiday. Except
     that, Cultural Affairs Bureau is nearby. It's good to
     lingered for all day in there.

                          Test preparation

     method : As two or one week ago, I will start
     preparation test. Some subjects are difficult,  can
     advance preparation, if you have question, you could
     also ask your  classmate or teacher.When test is
     comming, I don't worry too much, because I already
     prepared.

     result : When middle test over, I see my score, em....
     not too bad, I think it's good. At the moment, I think
     it's to be worth. Although before test, I studying
     hard and  hard,but it's worth it.





                           Going to Korea

     Methodï¼ 
             So, if I want to go to Korea, I must learn
     Korean right now. By the way, I need to save money. And
     when will we go to Korea? How long will we stay there?
     Do we travel with tourist group? We need to discuss.
     Resultï¼ 
             I bought a book which can learn basic Korean.
     And I read it when I wait for bus or on the bus. Now I
     know some vowels and consonants. And I can say some
     simple words. I both want to study the Korean class in
     NUU. But that time I have another things to do. So I
     hope I can study it before I graduate. And some
     holidays my previous boss will call me to help her. And
     I can earn some money. I will save it as my fund. We
     plan to visit Korea in 2012â  s simmer, and stay there
     about five days. My sister told me that travel with
     tourist group will be better. Because she think I will
     lose my way.

         Relation between the 4 sections of the IMRD essay.

     What is the benefit for me from reading your essay? What can
     I learn from your experience. I am interested in knowing
     general principles, understanding how things work, understanding
     how I can be successful.

     You have had experiences I haven't had. I want to learn from
     things you have done.

     If you are successful, I can learn from your experience.
     If you AREN'T successful. I can ALSO learn from your experience.

     The RESULTS are like a proof of whether what you said in the
     INTRODUCTION is right.

     The METHOD is how you're going to show what you said in lhe
     INTRODUCTION is right.

     The DISCUSSION is about the RESULTS and the INTRODUCTION.

     reaction to her Mother's Day treatment?

     How did she feel? It might have been difficult to
     answer, but you could have guessed. You don't say
     how she reacted! It's not really an investigation.

     Put the question your father asked you in the introduction.
     Why is it a good question? What did you think about the
     question before you started the job?

     Did working there change your attitude to kids?

     As written, the essay doesn't fit the IMRD format.

                Looking forward to a brilliant career

     Think about what you want to do in the future with
     your life.  Think about your career. Think about
     where you will be when you are the same age as
     your parents.

     What kind of accomplishments or achievements would

     kind of life journey?

     Don't write the essay in the IMRD form. I don't
     want you to DO anything about your career. I just
     want you think and to write down your thoughts
     about where you are going and how you are going to
     get there.

     outcome in mind."

     introduction : Many people want to look for a good job, near you live, money is high, and don't do anything things. This is many people's dream. But s omeone looking for a job, which is interesting to them. Some people have a high salary but they don't happiness, the other although don't have high salary, but they find their interesting things, they look happy. This inspire me thinking, what type job should I find? Interesting but lower salary? Hard and boring job but high salary? It's so difficult decision.

     method : Although I am a student now, but time is so fast, about two years I have to find a job. I always thinking when I graduate from university, what can I do ? At the end, don't have any sure answer, but I decide to learn more languages.  Language is a tool, is a important tool. I want to learn english, german language, japaness language, french language.

     result : Now I am so busy at school, I decide when summer vacation, I will learn more about languages. Last summmer vacation, I went to bookstore to bought about Japaness language's book. Learning by myself for a long time, I thought it is so interesting. But gradually, school life is busy, so I don't have time to read it. I stopped this plane. This summer vacation, I restart to read it.

     discuss : Although language is important, but it is total not you can rely on this to find a job. Unless your job is translate person, or it is just a tool, not a skill. Language can make you to more easier to find a job, if your know language is more others, your enroll is relatively high.

                                Annie

     My career
     I:
             Actually, I donâ  t know what is my future job. When I was young, I though
     t I will become a teacher. But when I was in senior high school, I discovered t
     hat I was interested in computer. So I fill up the voluntary form that is NUU I
     nformation Management Department. When I entered it, I felt it doesnâ  t like wha
     t I think. So I felt bad in that moment. I asked myself:â   Is that what I want?
     â   But afterward I gradually realized what I learn. I recognized that is not as
     hard as I assumed and it is interesting!

     M:
             And then I start to project my future. Because I major in Information Ma
     nagement, so of course I want to be a programmer. I want to design some web pag
     es programmerã  games programmer and system programmer. But I run into some trou
     bles. I donâ  t know how to undertake. Actually when I was in first grade, I didn
     â  t study hard. In C++ class, I always fall asleep. So I didnâ  t emulate my bette
     rs. It causes that I donâ  t know how to begin the program. So I asked my friend
     who is good at programmer how to write the programmer? How to promote my progra
     mmer ability? What is the tips to learn program better?

     R:
             He told me that I am a novice, so start from the basic programmer. And o
     f course I will encounter some great difficulties. But just try it. If you donâ  
     t try it, you wonâ  t learn more! And he introduce me some programâ  s book. He sai
     d: â  Just look others programmer and try it â   â  If you meet up troubles, just ask

     D:
             As a matter of fact, itâ  s dogged as does it. Donâ  t give up when you run
     into troubles. Change another side, you will find the solution. Just like me, I
      have ever wanted to give up and changed to other department. I think I canâ  t b
     e a programmer. But my classmate helped me a lot. He told me the tips to learn
     programmer and answered my programmer question. So it becomes smooth. Just than
     ks a lot for him.
 Donâ  t be shy.â  

                                Jill

     Since I loved to read novels, I sometimes imagine that maybe one day I can write
      a
     story myself. I often write good and bad things happened in my life on my notebo
     ok.
     But I always unable to practice. One day, I read a piece of writing about litera
     ry
     criticism, mentioned that a commentary is not created through attached to a work
      or a
     creator. A real commentary should bridge work and viewers' communication, and co
     uld
     inspire inspiration even some thinking. The writing changed my impression that I

     considered in the past and make me hope to make a study of commentary.

     Although my major subject is finance, I'm sure that I'm not the person for this
     area.
     I have applied for civil service examination related to culture administration,
     hoping
     to have a change in my life. Actually, I want to spend twenty years touring as f
     ar as
     possible, than come back and stay in Taiwan when I'm the same age as my parents.
      Or
     maybe I will find somewhere that I don't want to leave. But when I'm reading a b
     ook,
     watching a movie, and any form of art, it's just like a tour to me. As any tour
     with
     reality, you should be gained form it, shallow or deep.

     It need much courage to decide not to follow what I have learned for four years,
      I
     wish that I always hold courage and never reduce my enthusiasm on learning.



                                Chad

         Talk about the future? it's a nice topic.Sometimes i'm confused when i'm
     thinking my future because it seems that I'm not really interested in what i
     major in now. I major in computer science and information engineering,
     most of our course is about programming. It's kind of logical and tiring
     course for me even though  i just a freshman now.Unexpectedly, I failed
     on programming class last semester, meanwhile, I started to think if I continue
     to program untill i'm graduated. What king of job will I have? programming
     all day long, begin to work at 8am, get off duty at least at 7pm.






                              Shang-hao

     Job? Hm.. Sure everyone want to get a good job. What do mean by god job? Easy wo
     rk to do but have the high salary? Work in the office with air-conditioning and
      have a secretary? Yeah, it could be anything you like about the job. So what j
     ob you want to have?
     For some people, they may think they never want to have a job, or work for other
      people or a company. They just want to do business by themselves, they don't w
     ant limited by time, or command by boss. Yeah, it would be good too.
     But before that, you must have an experiences for something you want to do. For
     example, if you want to start to open a small stores like electronic stores. At
      least you must have an experience first, like you ever working as an employee
     in electronic store, you ever fix some kind of electronic stuff.
     By having that experience you are really prepared to do your own business.

     But how if you never have any experience before? hm, you just can work in a comp
     any after you graduate from university. What job will you get later was dependi
     ng on the majority that you take now. So, before you enter the university, you
     must think best for your future, what kind of job would you like to get in the
     future. Because the choices of the subject or major in the university would hav
     e a big influence in your future. Besides all of that, what job will you get is
      depending on you skill. What skill do you have? Is good or not? Is your skill
     was needed by someone or company? Then you will get a good job too. For this on
     e was really hard to say, better you just play save mode, by looking for experi
     ence, do something different and do it better than before.

     For me, when I was 8 years old, my uncle had a workshop. So, after finished my s
     chool I would be there in the workshop to learn and do some work. Then every we
     ek my uncle would give me some money. Great! I can have my own money. Then I st
     arted to pay school fee by myself that time, buy anything with my own money, I
     never ask money from my parents. I just work for my uncle until I was in junior
      high school, I moved to different school and live with my aunt. But in the new
      place that I lived, my uncle have a friend that have a workshop too but electr
     onics devices major. Great! I learn something new again. Just like before, I go
      to school and having part time job, and had my own money. It's going to be lik
     e that until I enter senior high school. I was no longer in electronic devices
     after senior high school. My first year of senior high school, I was required t
     o be a teacher, teaching elementary kids. Not bad, this job more convenient tha
     n workshop. But it just for one year, after that I back to workshop but in mach
     ine majority. I learn how to fix a machine, and it's more complicated than befo
     re. I did learn machine until I graduate from senior high school.

     That was my experience of work. I think I would be ready for the next job or fin
     ding a job after I graduate from university.

     Good essay, about last week's experience. Bad points: too
     short. A good summary, but a bad essay.

                          Week 17 Homework

     You wrote about thinking globally in terms of your own achievements.
     That is, you have a future aspiration, or you are thinking about
     some time in the distant future, but you can only act in the here
     and now.

     How do you get from where you are to where you want to be?

     For the homework next week and for the exam in Week 18,
     I want you to think about someone else's achievement.

     Ask/suggest them do something to get closer to a future goal.

     The thing you ask them to do should not be too difficult. If it is
     too difficult they won't do it.

     Ask something which you think there is a 50-50 chance they will do.

     (heads and tails)

     Eg look at a web site. Or read a page in the textbook for homework.

     Check that they did it by asking them questions they can only answer
     if they did it.

     Eg a question in the textbook, or a question,
     what is the web site page all about.

                           Final activity

     Some future work

     My effort to get you to write each week on the Internet
     was a failure. I am afraid after this class, you will not
     continue to write any English regularly.

     As a result, you will not reach the goal you had when you
     decided to take the class.

     I will have failed. And you will have failed.

     But perhaps, YOU will not fail in some other thing
     I want you to do.  Maybe, as a result of what YOU
     say today, your classmates will continue to do
     some writing that will enable them to reach the
     goal that they had in March.

     Just like you wrote about last week, I want you to
     ask/advise everyone in the class to try to do some easy
     (but new) activity that you think might help them become a
     writer of English.

     Don't say they should do something that it is
     clear they won't do. Choose something they have
     a 50-50 chance of doing.

     I will ask you to stand up in front of the room
     and present a proposal. In Introduction, Method,
     Expected Results format.

     This is a proposal for your partner to study. You
     don't know what's going to happen. They don't

     Like the grant proposal before, you don't know if
     it is going to be successful or not. But this time,
     you want other people to study if it works or not,
     not you.

     However you can imagine what RESULTS your
     classmates may get, and you can decide how you
     would EVALUATE, JUDGE their results. What would be
     success?  What would be failure?

       In the INTRODUCTION, think of these questions.

       * Is the proposal clear and easy to understand?
       * Is it a research problem (something new), or is it just
        doing something they already know about?
       * Is it an important problem, whose solution will have useful
         effects?
       * Is a lot of work necessary to solve the problem, or can it be done
        without much work?
       * Do your classmates have a good idea on which to base their work?
       * Does the proposal explain clearly what work should be done?
       * Do classmates know about the work that
         others have done on the problem?
       * Do classmates have a track record of doing similar work?

     Shortcomings:

       * It is not clear what problem the proposal is talking about.
       * The question/problem is not well expressed.
       * It is not clear why the work is worth doing.
       * The proposal is not about something new. It's just a
               routine others do.
       * There is no evidence that classmates will succeed where others
         have failed.
            + "We have an idea".
            + "We have a good track record".
       * A new idea is claimed but there are no details of how the
         idea is going to be carried out.
       * The proposers seem unaware of related research.
       * The proposed work has already been done.
       * The proposal is badly presented, or incomprehensible.
       * The proposers seem to be attempting too much.
       * The proposal is too expensive for the probable gain.

     *Opinion and survey about Education and NUU.
          *The best way to learn English

     Opinion: Why this is an important question?
     Ans       : Of course this is an important question. First, we know that English is a universal language that used by every country in every side.
                     So that's why we need to learn English and what is the best way to learn English?
                     There's a lot of way to improve our English skill. Start from the easiest way, you need to read an English subject or topic like reading
                     an English books at least 10-15 minutes every day. When your reading skill is getting better, you will enjoy to reading English.
                     The other way is try to listening to English music, try to sing it out, it's a lot of fun studying English by music. You can also watch
                     English movies, although it's little harder, but I suggest better do the first and the second way. Both of them are kind of fun and
                     best way to improve your English.

     What is the best way to improving our English?

     Intro

     All of us know that English is a very important language, it help us to connect with
     the whole world, whatever you major in. Supposing that English is not your mother
     tongue, what should we do? To take lessons after school? Or to have self-study would
     be better?


     Method

     I think the best way to improve English is stying in an English-speaking Countries.
     But usually we don't have enough resources to support us. So the best way is to join
     in a conversation class. To discuss news, books, life, different cultures etc. that
     something will force me to read.

     Lolly said: I was torment with some words that just recited by heart. Recently I
     started reading China Post. First, you will meet lots of words you seem to recited
     before, but can't remember what they are means. Do not check on the dictionary at
     once, you should read the context, to associate with one word in thinking. After
     reading the whole writings, on this moment you can check on the dictionary, than you
     can keep this word in mind. While the word appears again and again, you should not
     forget it anyhow.

     What is the best way to improving our English?

     Intro

     All of us know that English is a very important language, it help us to connect with
     the whole world, whatever you major in. Supposing that English is not your mother
     tongue, what should we do? To take lessons after school? Or to have self-study would
     be better?


     Method

     I think the best way to improve English is stying in an English-speaking Countries.
     But usually we don't have enough resources to support us. So the best way is to join
     in a conversation class. To discuss news, books, life, different cultures etc. that
     something will force me to read.

     started reading China Post. First, you will meet lots of words you seem to recited
     before, but can't remember what they are means. Do not check on the dictionary at
     once, you should read the context, to associate with one word in thinking. After
     reading the whole writings, on this moment you can check on the dictionary, than you
     can keep this word in mind. While the word appears again and again, you should not
     forget it anyhow.

       To solve this problem,there are several ways which are from my friends opinions.
     First of all,my classmate,Paul,said that he didn’t care about the size of the resta

     The other way is try to listening to English music, try to sing

     better do the first and the second way. Both of them are kind of
     fun an best way to improve your English.

              The size of school restaurant

       Every lunch time when i get into school restaurant,i see all
     the seats are seated a +nd air is so smelly especially in
     summer.Furthurmore,there are few meal for me to choo -se.Because
     of these problems,i have a question”For the quality of our
     mealtime and space for eating,how could we improve our restaurant?”








       To solve this problem,there are several ways which are from my
     friends opinions.  First of all,my classmate,Paul,said that he
     didn’t care about the size of the resta ur+ant, but he did care
     about the meal choices of the restaurant.So he advised to have
     more vendor in our school.Second,my friend,Monica,thought the
     best way to solve this pr- oblem is to build a new building
     called No.2 student’s restaurant.Third,my colleague,said that the
     “BAJA”is the best way to improve our problem.









     In my opinion,Paul’s advice is not suitable for most of students
     because he lives i+n dormitory,he doesn’t have to care about the
     quality of the restaurant.So i think it i+s not the best
     way.Additionally,my thoughts to Monica is that it will cost too
     much m- oney to build a new building and there is no more space
     to build.Moreover,the third advice is the shorttest one but the
     most efficiency one.Move to “BAJA” is definit ly the best way to
     solve this problem because the place is bigger and the quality of
     the + restaurant will evacuate.

      II. NOT A REAL story of something new you tried, something that was risky
        Instead: A RESEARCH GRANT PROPOSAL

       Like professors here with the NSC, imagine some rich person
       or organization wants to give you money to carry out a project
       that interests you. They want to give you money, but they
       also expects some results. The results might be personal
       learning for just yourself, or they might be results with
       social benefits.

       The benefactor wants to know if giving you the money will
       results in benefits or not. If it won't, then they won't give
       you the money.

       The grant proposal is very similar to an IMRD essay, so use
       the IMRD format. But you don't have the results, because you
       haven't carried out your idea yet.

       However you can imagine what RESULTS you will get, and you can
       decide how you will EVALUATE, JUDGE the results. What will be success?
       What will be failure?

       You should say what may be learned from the project in a
       CONCLUSION.

       In the INTRODUCTION, think of these questions.

       * Is the proposal clear and easy to understand?
       * Is it a research problem (something new), or is it just
        doing something you already know about?
       * Is it an important problem, whose solution will have useful
         effects?
       * Is money necessary to solve the problem, or can it be done
        without money?
       * Do the proposers have a good idea on which to base their work?
       * Does the proposal explain clearly what work will be done?
       * Do the proposers know about the work that
         others have done on the problem?
       * Do the proposers have a track record of doing similar work?

     Shortcomings:

          * It is not clear what problem the proposal is talking about.
          * The question/problem is not well expressed.
          * It is not clear why the question is worth asking.
          * The proposal is not about something new. It's just a
             routine application of known techniques.
          * There is no evidence that the proposers will succeed where others
            have failed.
               + "We have an idea".
               + "We have a good track record".
          * A new idea is claimed but there are no details of how the
            idea is going to be carried out.
          * The proposers seem unaware of related research.
          * The proposed research has already been done.
          * The proposal is badly presented, or incomprehensible.
          * The proposers seem to be attempting too much.
          * The proposal is too expensive for the probable gain.
          * The proposers institution should be funding it.

       * Does the proposal explain clearly what work will be done?
       * Do the proposers know about the work that
         others have done on the problem?
       * Do the proposers have a track record of doing similar work?

     Shortcomings:

          * It is not clear what problem the proposal is talking about.
          * The question/problem is not well expressed.
          * It is not clear why the question is worth asking.
          * The proposal is not about something new. It's just a
             routine application of known techniques.
          * There is no evidence that the proposers will succeed where others
            have failed.
               + "We have an idea".
               + "We have a good track record".
          * A new idea is claimed but there are no details of how the
            idea is going to be carried out.
          * The proposers seem unaware of related research.
          * The proposed research has already been done.
          * The proposal is badly presented, or incomprehensible.
          * The proposers seem to be attempting too much.
          * The proposal is too expensive for the probable gain.
          * The proposers institution should be funding it.

                         Homework for week 5

     City life: an experiment

     Think about it
     Do it
     Write about it

     IMRD format

     Eg,
     1. A new way to get to school
     2. A new way to arrange your room
     3. Exploring the neighborhood
     4. Eating at a different place

     The difficult part is Method and Results--try to keep them
     separate.

                   Explanation of Week 5 homework

     I want you to plan to do something very, very simple, and to
     actually do it.

     Write about the planning in the Introduction. Why do you
     want to do it?

     Write about what you are going to do before you do it in the
     Method. What? Where? When? Who with?

     Write about what you did in the Results.
     What? Where? When? Who with?

     What you planned and what you actually did will probably be
     different. What did you see, hear and think while you were
     doing the activity? What happened that was unexpected?

     In the Discussion/Conclusion, write about what you thought
     after finishing doing the activity, and what you think now.
     What did you learn, and what will you do next time?

                       Walking to school (May)

     I always ride the motorcycle to the school to have
     a class usually, though will not be too far from
     place that I live now to school, it probably only
     costs 50 minutes to the school..

     One day, because I have finished class, going back
     by motorcycle, then I meet one's own classmate on
     the road, I see him walk home, I think he don't
     have transportation, it is has to go home on foot
     to have no alternative. But, I ride to by him and
     stop to ask whether he needed to hitchhike, he
     answered me ...

      Can you guess what he said?

      Method/
     There is it, I think the weather is quite sunny,
     and I have enough time, do not have something
     urgent, have an hour in class period, while going
     out, I plan to try to go to the school by walking,
     because the residence position is relatively high,
     it will pass a section of downhill paths to get
     before the school, so this road will not be too
     difficult, in this distance. I find that go to
     school on foot there are a lot of junior school
     students and high school students.


     Result/
     During the process of going to school, though very
     smooth, have not had some difficulties, and let my
     mood of morning be quite good, but after I am in
     the school finish course for a whole day, being
     all tired when already analogous to the body and
     minding, I just want to come back home and have a
     good rest quickly in the mind, ...

                 Exploring the neighborhood (Annie)

     Introdution:
     I think keeping good neighborhood is an important
     thing in our life. Because sometimes you will need
     others help. So you need to know about your
     neighborhood.
     ... I hope I can get along with them friendly.

     Method:
     First, I must know who are they? What do they do?
     How long do they live here? Which floor do they
     live? How many people in their home? Second, I
     should told them who am I. ....And hope we can
     help each other.

     Result:
     One day I finished my class, and I came into my
     home, I saw my neighbor next to me. And she looks
     friendly. So I said hello to her and chat with
     her. She is nice and kind. She knew I am a
     student, so she said if I want to eat home-made
     food, I can go to there to join their dinner.

     She certainly welcomes me. After I hear that, I’m
     so happy! Because I hear my classmate said that
     she has a bad neighbor. ...

     Sometimes I finish my class late and I can’t catch
     the garbage car, my neighbor will help me to throw
     them.

     Discussion:
     After this event, I think I will live here until I
     graduate. I certainly realize that to go out can
     rely on friend、 live outsides can rely on
     neighbor!!

     minding, I just want to come back home and have a
     good rest quickly in the mind, ...

      Can you guess what happened next?


                       Walking to school (May)

     I always ride the motorcycle to the school to have
     a class usually, though will not be too far from
     place that I live now to school, it probably only
     costs 50 minutes to the school..

     One day, because I have finished class, going back
     by motorcycle, then I meet one's own classmate on
     the road, I see him walk home, I think he don't
     have transportation, it is has to go home on foot
     to have no alternative. But, I ride to by him and
     stop to ask whether he needed to hitchhike, he
     answered me ...

      Can you guess what he said?

      Method/
     There is it, I think the weather is quite sunny,
     and I have enough time, do not have something
     urgent, have an hour in class period, while going
     out, I plan to try to go to the school by walking,
     because the residence position is relatively high,
     it will pass a section of downhill paths to get
     before the school, so this road will not be too
     difficult, in this distance. I find that go to
     school on foot there are a lot of junior school
     students and high school students.


     Result/
     During the process of going to school, though very
     smooth, have not had some difficulties, and let my
     mood of morning be quite good, but after I am in
     the school finish course for a whole day, being
     all tired when already analogous to the body and
     minding, I just want to come back home and have a
     good rest quickly in the mind, ...

      Can you guess what happened next?

      Discuision/
     It is a quite relaxed and simple stroll sport to
     in fact get to the school on foot in the morning,
     beneficial ...

     At last, thought there are lots of things that we

               Subject: U9534040: Having a phone call

     Intro

     Tomb Sweeping Festival is a day that Chinese
     people go back home to do memorial service to
     their ancestry. In the cause of this day, schools
     and companies usually have some vacations around
     April fifth, ....

     Guess what Jill said next.

      so that people can have their family
     reunion, and I will come back to  Kaohsiung in
     these days.

     Method

     This year, April fifth is happening to Monday,
     therefore some universities and companies will
     going to have one more holiday after Tomb Sweeping
     Festival, so that people don't have to return to
     their working position in a hurry. But NUU only
     have one holiday for Tomb Sweeping Festival this
     year,

     Guess what Jill said next.

      so I have no choice but to back to school in
     that day. Therefore, I had a phone call to my
     mother asking if we can advance the date to visit
     a tomb.

     Result

     My mother told me because of Tomb Sweeping
     Festival is just on Monday, a lot of people have
     to work on the next day, so that is no problem to
     visit a tomb ahead of time.

     Guess what Jill said next. I don't think you can.


      After that, we chat about things on her
     business. It seems that there will be a new
     manager to come in her office, we a little
     discussed about that. And my brother studying in
     the freshman year is caring about how
     he looks again.

     At last, thought there are lots of things that we
     can talk, worry about the cell phone fees will go
     beyond the budget, so we decided to talk more talk
     in the term I back home.

     Conclusion

     Guess what Jill said next.

      Because the object of a talk is a close family, I
     can say no matter what topics of conversation
     relaxedly. It really good to have someone I can

      We don’t have to care the problem about
     distance.So, if I have leisure time, I will use
     skype to phone my relatives who live in America.
     It’s not only free but also convenient.

     Method：
             To make this call, I just want to know how
     do they do? How about the weather? It’s there
     hot? Will they come back to Taiwan? Do they have

               H F Cheng's paper on teacher education

     Method

     Participants were twenty-one elementary in-service teachers, pursing an
     English teacher certificate offered by the researcher{\textquoteright}s
     university. They were required to take ten two-credit courses, each of
     which lasted for 36 hours. The data came from one of the courses,
     designing English learning activities and materials, taught by the
     researcher. The course requirement asked teachers to conduct a
     small-scale project about their own learning to teach children to learn
     with implementing one type of learning activities introduced in the
     course, information gap activities.


     In the training course, the group met every Saturday afternoon for four
     hours. The course lasted for nine weeks. At the beginning of the
     course, they were first guided by the researcher to design information
     gap activities in a four-hour workshop. Sample activity sheets were
     also used to guide the teachers to practice doing the task. Language
     learning principles and design tips were included in the workshop.
     Next, they were allowed for two weeks to design their first individual
     information gap worksheets based on a chosen lesson from a textbook
     their students were using. Later, they discussed with peers and the
     researcher about their activity sheets in a two-hour session.

     To better understand teachers{\textquoteright} opinions about
     participating in this learning community, a questionnaire was designed
     to collect data from the teachers (see Appendix 1). For this present
     study, ten statements regarding the purpose of this study were used for
     data analysis. All items asked the participants to indicate their
     responses from strongly agree to strongly disagree with each of the
     statements,

     Results

     Quantitative data regarding how teachers have learned to teach with
     the theory of incorporating information gap activities in their
     teaching are first presented in Table 1, showing the means of
     teachers{\textquoteright} responses to Item 1, 2, and 8. The mean of
     Item 1 is 2.1, which means at the beginning of attending this training
     course, the participants did not know how to use information gap
     activities in English teaching. After the researcher further examined
     percentage of teachers{\textquoteright} responses, only 16.7\% of the
     teachers checked they knew about this type of activity. The means of
     Item 2 and Item 8 are 4.2 and 4.5. Examining the data further, the
     researcher first found 89\% of the participants indicated that they
     strongly agreed and agreed that they could design the information gap
     well after taking this course and engaging in their teaching inquiry.
     Second, according to Item 8, all of the participants knew how to
     incorporate them in their teaching activities---the percentage of

                               Travel

     Method

     I am under the impression that a short trip can make
     your day life more happier and more fascinating. One of
     month can plane a trip scheme about 2 days or 3 days.
     And do not go away too far for your trip what is just
     about you can take a train without driving a
     car.Because of driving will be your encumbrance and
     make you tired out to enjoy your trip.

     Result

     At first I always ride my motorcycle to go out and just
     play in Miaoli. Then I always take a train to trip to
     others place. For example, Taichung or Hsinchu. Now I
     just like to carry some books and my mp3 to go to find
     a good tea bar and waste my Sunday afternoon.
     Sometimes I will just go out to play tennis with my
     friends and spend all day night to watch DVD.

                               Museum

     Method

     First thing I had to do is to watch the website of the
     museum to inquire about the museum hours and how to
     get to the museum. Second, I prepared some information
     I have to collect that those will be used in my report.

     Result

     Between walking around the museum, there were many
     children studying in elementary school are about to
     start their field trip at the same, it makes the quiet
     museum become more lively. I saw one of a boy stood in
     front of a paint he thought it's very interesting,
     bring out his notebook and than started drawing that
     paint in it. After doing that, he shared to his friends
     and they all laughed. What a warm and interesting
     moment!

     There is one thing I was ignored till time to go home.
     Outside of the main building, many kind of aquatics
     were grown in a ditch, and fishes in it. National
     Taiwan Museum of Fine Arts has green grassland with
     some work of art on it, I think families living nearby
     are surely walk on the green grass on holiday. Except
     that, Cultural Affairs Bureau is nearby. It's good to
     lingered for all day in there.

                          Test preparation

     method : As two or one week ago, I will start
     preparation test. Some subjects are difficult,  can
     advance preparation, if you have question, you could
     also ask your  classmate or teacher.When test is
     comming, I don't worry too much, because I already
     prepared.

     result : When middle test over, I see my score, em....
     not too bad, I think it's good. At the moment, I think
     it's to be worth. Although before test, I studying
     hard and  hard,but it's worth it.





                           Going to Korea

     Method：
             So, if I want to go to Korea, I must learn
     Korean right now. By the way, I need to save money. And
     when will we go to Korea? How long will we stay there?
     Do we travel with tourist group? We need to discuss.
     Result：
             I bought a book which can learn basic Korean.
     And I read it when I wait for bus or on the bus. Now I
     know some vowels and consonants. And I can say some
     simple words. I both want to study the Korean class in
     NUU. But that time I have another things to do. So I
     hope I can study it before I graduate. And some
     holidays my previous boss will call me to help her. And
     I can earn some money. I will save it as my fund. We
     plan to visit Korea in 2012’s simmer, and stay there
     about five days. My sister told me that travel with
     tourist group will be better. Because she think I will
     lose my way.

         Relation between the 4 sections of the IMRD essay.

     What is the benefit for me from reading your essay? What can
     I learn from your experience. I am interested in knowing
     general principles, understanding how things work, understanding
     how I can be successful.

     You have had experiences I haven't had. I want to learn from
     things you have done.

     If you are successful, I can learn from your experience.
     If you AREN'T successful. I can ALSO learn from your experience.

     The RESULTS are like a proof of whether what you said in the
     INTRODUCTION is right.

     The METHOD is how you're going to show what you said in lhe
     INTRODUCTION is right.

     The DISCUSSION is about the RESULTS and the INTRODUCTION.

     how she reacted! It's not really an investigation.

     Why is it a good question? What did you think about the
     question before you started the job?

     Did working there change your attitude to kids?

     As written, the essay doesn't fit the IMRD format.







                Looking forward to a brilliant career

     Think about what you want to do in the future with
     your life.  Think about your career. Think about
     where you will be when you are the same age as
     your parents.

     What kind of accomplishments or achievements would
     you like to have achieved in your career, or other
     kind of life journey?

     Don't write the essay in the IMRD form. I don't
     want you to DO anything about your career. I just
     want you think and to write down your thoughts
     about where you are going and how you are going to
     get there.

     "The secret of achievement is to hold a picture of a successful
     outcome in mind."

     introduction : Many people want to look for a good job, near you live, money is high, and don't do anything things. This is many people's dream. But s omeone looking for a job, which is interesting to them. Some people have a high salary but they don't happiness, the other although don't have high salary, but they find their interesting things, they look happy. This inspire me thinking, what type job should I find? Interesting but lower salary? Hard and boring job but high salary? It's so difficult decision.

     method : Although I am a student now, but time is so fast, about two years I have to find a job. I always thinking when I graduate from university, what can I do ? At the end, don't have any sure answer, but I decide to learn more languages.  Language is a tool, is a important tool. I want to learn english, german language, japaness language, french language.

     result : Now I am so busy at school, I decide when summer vacation, I will learn more about languages. Last summmer vacation, I went to bookstore to bought about Japaness language's book. Learning by myself for a long time, I thought it is so interesting. But gradually, school life is busy, so I don't have time to read it. I stopped this plane. This summer vacation, I restart to read it.

     discuss : Although language is important, but it is total not you can rely on this to find a job. Unless your job is translate person, or it is just a tool, not a skill. Language can make you to more easier to find a job, if your know language is more others, your enroll is relatively high.

                                Annie

     My career
     I:
             Actually, I don’t know what is my future job. When I was young, I though
     t I will become a teacher. But when I was in senior high school, I discovered t
     hat I was interested in computer. So I fill up the voluntary form that is NUU I
     nformation Management Department. When I entered it, I felt it doesn’t like wha
     t I think. So I felt bad in that moment. I asked myself:” Is that what I want?
     ” But afterward I gradually realized what I learn. I recognized that is not as
     hard as I assumed and it is interesting!

     M:
             And then I start to project my future. Because I major in Information Ma
     nagement, so of course I want to be a programmer. I want to design some web pag
     es programmer、games programmer and system programmer. But I run into some trou
     bles. I don’t know how to undertake. Actually when I was in first grade, I didn
     ’t study hard. In C++ class, I always fall asleep. So I didn’t emulate my bette
     rs. It causes that I don’t know how to begin the program. So I asked my friend
     who is good at programmer how to write the programmer? How to promote my progra
     mmer ability? What is the tips to learn program better?

     R:
             He told me that I am a novice, so start from the basic programmer. And o
     f course I will encounter some great difficulties. But just try it. If you don’
     t try it, you won’t learn more! And he introduce me some program’s book. He sai
     d: “Just look others programmer and try it “ ”If you meet up troubles, just ask

     D:
             As a matter of fact, it’s dogged as does it. Don’t give up when you run
     into troubles. Change another side, you will find the solution. Just like me, I
      have ever wanted to give up and changed to other department. I think I can’t b
     e a programmer. But my classmate helped me a lot. He told me the tips to learn
     programmer and answered my programmer question. So it becomes smooth. Just than
     ks a lot for him.
 Don’t be shy.”

                                Jill

     Since I loved to read novels, I sometimes imagine that maybe one day I can write
      a
     story myself. I often write good and bad things happened in my life on my notebo
     ok.
     But I always unable to practice. One day, I read a piece of writing about litera
     ry
     criticism, mentioned that a commentary is not created through attached to a work
      or a
     creator. A real commentary should bridge work and viewers' communication, and co
     uld
     inspire inspiration even some thinking. The writing changed my impression that I

     considered in the past and make me hope to make a study of commentary.

     Although my major subject is finance, I'm sure that I'm not the person for this
     area.
     I have applied for civil service examination related to culture administration,
     hoping
     to have a change in my life. Actually, I want to spend twenty years touring as f
     ar as
     possible, than come back and stay in Taiwan when I'm the same age as my parents.
      Or
     maybe I will find somewhere that I don't want to leave. But when I'm reading a b
     ook,
     watching a movie, and any form of art, it's just like a tour to me. As any tour
     with
     reality, you should be gained form it, shallow or deep.

     It need much courage to decide not to follow what I have learned for four years,
      I
     wish that I always hold courage and never reduce my enthusiasm on learning.



                                Chad

         Talk about the future? it's a nice topic.Sometimes i'm confused when i'm
     thinking my future because it seems that I'm not really interested in what i
     major in now. I major in computer science and information engineering,
     most of our course is about programming. It's kind of logical and tiring
     course for me even though  i just a freshman now.Unexpectedly, I failed
     on programming class last semester, meanwhile, I started to think if I continue
     to program untill i'm graduated. What king of job will I have? programming
     all day long, begin to work at 8am, get off duty at least at 7pm.






                              Shang-hao

     Job? Hm.. Sure everyone want to get a good job. What do mean by god job? Easy wo
     rk to do but have the high salary? Work in the office with air-conditioning and
      have a secretary? Yeah, it could be anything you like about the job. So what j
     ob you want to have?
     For some people, they may think they never want to have a job, or work for other
      people or a company. They just want to do business by themselves, they don't w
     ant limited by time, or command by boss. Yeah, it would be good too.
     But before that, you must have an experiences for something you want to do. For
     example, if you want to start to open a small stores like electronic stores. At
      least you must have an experience first, like you ever working as an employee
     in electronic store, you ever fix some kind of electronic stuff.
     By having that experience you are really prepared to do your own business.

     But how if you never have any experience before? hm, you just can work in a comp
     any after you graduate from university. What job will you get later was dependi
     ng on the majority that you take now. So, before you enter the university, you
     must think best for your future, what kind of job would you like to get in the
     future. Because the choices of the subject or major in the university would hav
     e a big influence in your future. Besides all of that, what job will you get is
      depending on you skill. What skill do you have? Is good or not? Is your skill
     was needed by someone or company? Then you will get a good job too. For this on
     e was really hard to say, better you just play save mode, by looking for experi
     ence, do something different and do it better than before.

     For me, when I was 8 years old, my uncle had a workshop. So, after finished my s
     chool I would be there in the workshop to learn and do some work. Then every we
     ek my uncle would give me some money. Great! I can have my own money. Then I st
     arted to pay school fee by myself that time, buy anything with my own money, I
     never ask money from my parents. I just work for my uncle until I was in junior
      high school, I moved to different school and live with my aunt. But in the new
      place that I lived, my uncle have a friend that have a workshop too but electr
     onics devices major. Great! I learn something new again. Just like before, I go
      to school and having part time job, and had my own money. It's going to be lik
     e that until I enter senior high school. I was no longer in electronic devices
     after senior high school. My first year of senior high school, I was required t
     o be a teacher, teaching elementary kids. Not bad, this job more convenient tha
     n workshop. But it just for one year, after that I back to workshop but in mach
     ine majority. I learn how to fix a machine, and it's more complicated than befo
     re. I did learn machine until I graduate from senior high school.

     That was my experience of work. I think I would be ready for the next job or fin
     ding a job after I graduate from university.

        No homework last week




                          Week 17 Homework

     You wrote about thinking globally in terms of your own achievements.
     That is, you have a future aspiration, or you are thinking about
     some time in the distant future, but you can only act in the here
     and now.

     How do you get from where you are to where you want to be?

     For the homework next week and for the exam in Week 18,
     I want you to think about someone else's achievement.

     Ask/suggest them do something to get closer to a future goal.

     The thing you ask them to do should not be too difficult. If it is
     too difficult they won't do it.

     Ask something which you think there is a 50-50 chance they will do.

     (heads and tails)

     Eg look at a web site. Or read a page in the textbook for homework.

     Check that they did it by asking them questions they can only answer
     if they did it.

     Eg a question in the textbook, or a question,
     what is the web site page all about.

                           Final activity

     Some future work

     My effort to get you to write each week on the Internet
     was a failure. I am afraid after this class, you will not
     continue to write any English regularly.

     As a result, you will not reach the goal you had when you
     decided to take the class.

     I will have failed. And you will have failed.

     But perhaps, YOU will not fail in some other thing
     I want you to do.  Maybe, as a result of what YOU
     say today, your classmates will continue to do
     some writing that will enable them to reach the
     goal that they had in March.

     Just like you wrote about last week, I want you to
     ask/advise everyone in the class to try to do some easy
     (but new) activity that you think might help them become a
     writer of English.

     Don't say they should do something that it is
     clear they won't do. Choose something they have
     a 50-50 chance of doing.

     I will ask you to stand up in front of the room
     and present a proposal. In Introduction, Method,
     Expected Results format.

     This is a proposal for your partner to study. You
     don't know what's going to happen. They don't

     Like the grant proposal before, you don't know if
     it is going to be successful or not. But this time,
     you want other people to study if it works or not,
     not you.

     However you can imagine what RESULTS your
     classmates may get, and you can decide how you
     would EVALUATE, JUDGE their results. What would be
     success?  What would be failure?

       In the INTRODUCTION, think of these questions.

       * Is the proposal clear and easy to understand?
       * Is it a research problem (something new), or is it just
        doing something they already know about?
       * Is it an important problem, whose solution will have useful
         effects?
       * Is a lot of work necessary to solve the problem, or can it be done
        without much work?
       * Do your classmates have a good idea on which to base their work?
       * Does the proposal explain clearly what work should be done?
       * Do classmates know about the work that
         others have done on the problem?
       * Do classmates have a track record of doing similar work?

     Shortcomings:

       * It is not clear what problem the proposal is talking about.
       * The question/problem is not well expressed.
       * It is not clear why the work is worth doing.
       * The proposal is not about something new. It's just a
               routine others do.
       * There is no evidence that classmates will succeed where others
         have failed.
            + "We have an idea".
            + "We have a good track record".
       * A new idea is claimed but there are no details of how the
         idea is going to be carried out.
       * The proposers seem unaware of related research.
       * The proposed work has already been done.
       * The proposal is badly presented, or incomprehensible.
       * The proposers seem to be attempting too much.
       * The proposal is too expensive for the probable gain.
