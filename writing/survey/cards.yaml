        Think of a burning issue. Write 2 questions to ask other members of the class their opinion.

        A good issue is the one you wrote about in Week 15, trying something out in or out of school. What do the others think of your experience? Then answer the questions posted by the others.

        Each time you write an answer your grade goes up by 1 point for a maximum of 9.

        Write down the question you are asking and will write about in Week 18.

        The other students have to choose which type of bias you are putting in your questioning. They will choose the type after seeing you ask some students your question and listening to the students' responses.

        Make the options they can choose:

        - non-response bias
        - acquiescence bias
        - desirability bias
        - demand characteristics
        - observer-expectancy effect

        Following the same format as the Week 16 survey write-up, another survey conducted in class. For example, about the other action research topic you did.

        But any topic is OK, as long as you don't write the same essay as the first survey.

        In the first 20 minutes, you will upload 2 questions each with 2 answers to the forum. For example,

                President Trump is a good president.

                * Yes
                * No

                Do you support the assassination of the Iranian general?

                * Yes
                * No

        The questions must be Yes/No questions or questions with only 2 answers (ie, no WH-questions).

        In the next 20 minutes, you will answer everyone else's questions.

        Every 30 minutes, I will ask you to submit what you have done so far even if it is only a sketch. You can then continue to edit the essay.
