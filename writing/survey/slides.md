# Survey

## class survey activity 1

You will ask students to answer your survey question with 2 answers.

You will commit to a guess at (a) what students really believe, like:

* 50% 1st alternative
* 50% 2nd alternative

You will commit to trying to get them to answer in a (b) certain other way, a way that is different than (a)

* 90% 1st alternative
* 10% 2nd alternative

You will try to keep secret (avoid letting them guess) what your (a) and (b) commitments are.

## class survey activity 2

We will model (pretend) to carry out a survey.
You will ask a _sample_ of students to answer your survey question, the question that you are going to write about in Week 18.

You will act in such a way that there is bias in the responses. You can ask another member of your group to act as an accomplice.

The other students have to guess which of the 4 biases you have put into your survey.

* sampling bias
* acquiescence bias
* desirability bias

* demand characteristics

* observer-expectancy effect

Try to make it not so clear that it is easy to guess, but clear enough to show there is a right answer.

Students will debate which type of bias is being exhibited.

# Survey bias

## Types

- [https://help.surveygizmo.com/help/survey-bias ](https://help.surveygizmo.com/help/survey-bias)
- [http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/writing/survey/bias.html ](http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/writing/survey/bias.html)


## Observer-expectancy effect

What the observer does (even subconsciously and in an involuntary way) often changes the way the subject responds

- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer-expectancy_effect ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer-expectancy_effect)
- [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clever_Hans)
- [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN1bMSbHKQQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN1bMSbHKQQ)

In medicine:

- [double-blind study](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blinded_experiment)
- [- placebo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66DtnikQkgI)

## Sampling bias

* sample: the people you ask
* population: all the people you are interested in 

The sample is supposed to _represent_ the population 

But it may be difficult to get a representative sample.

You ask a sample of the population your question, but the sample is not completely representative

You call up people on their phones and ask them whether they support Korean Fish or Vegetable English, but older people are less likely to have phones and so their views will be _under-represented._

## Non-Response bias

Some (a lot of) people don't answer your questions. Perhaps those people have different ideas.

You ask people who they support, Korean Fish or Vegetable English, but many don't answer.

Perhaps they don't want to tell you they support Vegetable English, because Miaoli is not a DPP area.

## Response bias

People respond, but their answers are not accurate. They are not revealing the truth about themselves.

### Acquiescence bias

### Desirability bias

### Demand characteristics

## Acquiescence bias

In general, people want to be agreeable. Often, survey respondents will tell you what you want to hear.

You say, "I'm doing a survey for Korean Fish." They say, "Yes, Korean Fish is OK." But they're just saying it to please you.

## Desirability bias

Survey respondents want to admit to desirable characteristics and deny undesirable characteristics.

People know most people in Taiwan are opposed to mainland China. They don't want to appear to support mainland China, so they also say they are opposed to mainland China, when you ask them. But they in fact support unification with China. They just don't say it.
 
## Demand characteristics.

The survey causes people to think about things in ways they haven't thought of before, and they come up with new answers that may surprise even them.

Dr Bean remembers being asked as a freshman in a survey the subjects that he liked in high school and he was surprised to place English at the top of the list, because he had never liked English in high school.

People asked to choose between Vegetable English and Korean Fish have to make a choice. Perhaps they have never thought about them before. This experience may change the way they think about the two.

## Avoiding response bias

To avoid response bias:

*  Ask neutrally worded questions
*  Make sure your answer options are not leading
*  Make your survey anonymous
*  Keep your affiliation secret as this can tip off your respondents on how you wish for them to answer

# Possible biases at work in responses to "Homework: A burning question: what do the others think?"

# Taiwan/US political surveys

# Survey methodology

## Burning question

1. Why it is important to find out what people think/want
2. The questions you will ask
3. The answers they gave
4. What it all means for the burning issue

Dr Bean's burning issue: one-on-one in big class

## 1. Why it is important to find out what people think/want

The teacher has some goals, but doesn't know what the students think about the goals.

What students think determine whether the teacher will be successful.

Students don't talk with the teacher in class.

The teacher must survey them outside class to find out what they think.

## 2. The questions you will ask

1. How important is it that the teacher talk to individual students in the class, rather than to the whole class or groups?

2. How can the teacher talk one-on-one, because there are so many students in the class?

## 3. The answers they gave

Some students think it is not necessary I speak one-on-one to everyone.

## 4. What it all means for the burning issue

Perhaps I should take a more relaxed approach.

# Students doing the same thing

## Naming

Let's put 'Why it is important to find out what people think/want' in the *Introduction*

Let's put 'The questions you will ask' in the *Method*

Let's put 'The answers they gave' in the *Results*

Let's put 'What it all means for the burning issue' in the *Discussion*. Discuss possible sources of bias in your survey.

## questions

On page 58, write a question that if answered, Yes, will show you are successful.

Write what you will do in the Method section on page 59.

# My understanding of someone else's plans to do something

## Procedure

First:

Tell the person next to you a food plan for next week.

Second:

Tell the person on the other side of you what the first person told you.


You will report what your second partner told you about her/his first partner's project.

What is the food area in which they are trying to do something?

What are they trying to do?

How will they decide if they are successful or not?

It doesn't matter if you didn't understand what your first partner said. In fact, it is better if you use your imagination. GIVE the first partner some ideas, GOALS, measures of SUCCESS.

# Cooking Research Exam--2 100-word essays

## Rubric

I WANT 

1. THE 4 HEADINGS: Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion. YOU MUST HAVE THEM. Write them at the top and write notes for each heading. Then use the headings AGAIN in the body of the essay.
2. 2 Questions in the Introduction. The answers to the 2 questions will tell us whether you were successful or not. NOT: Was it successful?, but Did the milk mixed with the wax gourd drink make it taste good but less sweet?

## Option 1--Food homework rewritten

Rewrite your food homework, with the opposite result. You were successful? Now imagine you were unsuccessful. The introduction and method will remain the same but the results and discussion will be different. The results will require your imagination, with lots of detail. In the discussion you can ANALYZE why you didn't fail, or how you can be successful next time.

## Option 2--Failed effort

Write about something you tried hard to do, but FAILED, in the last year. It must be a project whose failure you hold yourself accountable for. Eg, NOT something like failing to win the lottery. The result of a lottery is chance, and not dependent on what you do. In Method, write what you did. In the Results, describe the failure. In the Discussion, talk about why, what you could do next time, and what you think.

## Option 3--Teaching self language project

Think about a short, easy project to teach yourself some language. Not, "Teach myself German", but "Learn ten German words from the textbook next week," or "Find a foreigner and have a short conversation with him/her next week." You haven't done it yet, so Method, Results and Discussion will be imagined. 

## Reading partner's essay

Look at the essay results and discussion and say what you think the answers to their questions are. If they haven't written the results, imagine what the answers might be. And add another question that you think the essay could answer.

# Grading partner's essay

## 1-5 rubric

- _5_ 150+ words well-organized, grammatical and interesting, answering the question
- _4_ 100-150 words answering the question but not well organized or not grammatical or not interesting

- _2_ 10-20 words connected to the topic or text plagiarized (or remembered) by the student
- _1_ some words on the paper not connected to the topic
- _0_ nothing on the paper

# IMRAD Exam--2 150-word essays

## Requirements

I WANT

1. THE 4 HEADINGS: Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion. YOU MUST HAVE THEM. Write them at the top and write notes for each heading. Then use the  headings AGAIN in the body of the essay.
2. 2 Questions in the Introduction. The answers to the 2 questions will tell us whether you were successful or not. NOT: Was it successful?, but Did the milk mixed with the wax gourd drink make it taste good but less sweet?

## Essay 1--Food research

Write about a food experiment. Were you successful or not? Could be a restaurant you went to, or a recipe you tried to make, or a food you tried/bought. Try to remember what happened. You MUST have an Introduction (why, with 2 questions). Method (what), Results (what happened) and Discussion (what you think, learned).  Remember this is a story about one thing that happened one time, NOT, NOT a repeated experience. Talk about repeated experiences, but the focus is on the one-time event, and on success or failure.

## Essay 2--Shopping survey

Introduction: What do you want to find out from the people you will interview? Why is this an interesting survey to carry out. Method: 3 questions, 3 answers. Who will you ask?  Results: Imagine what the people told you in answer to each question. Imagine what else they said to you. Discussion: What do the Results of the survey mean to you? Try to generalize from your specific Results to a general statement about shopping. What do you think about people and about shopping? What questions will you ask next time?

## Planned language learning action research project Week 16-17

Students wrote essays at a high, abstract level--Good

Doing language learning at a low, concrete level is also good.

For the project, think at a high level, act at a low level--Name the words, sentences, things you are going to learn
