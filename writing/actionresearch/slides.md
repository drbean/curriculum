# Trying to do something, seeing how it goes, writing about it

## Do something!

Do it. Write about it.

1. plan/intention to do something
2. do it
3. write about it

## 1. intention to do something

It's getting cold, but I don't want to pull out my futon yet.

I like to air the bedclothes, but the futon is too heavy to hang up.

I will try covering up with some old sheets which I can hang up.

## 2. do it

I fold up the sheets and attach them to a clothes hanger, which I attach to the bed
so that I don't kick off the sheets while I'm sleeping.

## 3. did it work

I'm sleeping OK. But I'm waking up early, although my feet are not cold.

## 4. evaluating folded-up sheets

I won't be able to do this much longer as it is getting colder.

However, I think this was a successful experiment

Note: an unsuccessful experiment makes for more interesting reading. It's *good* to make a mistake.

# Students doing the same thing

## Naming

Let's call the plan (or intention) section the *Introduction*

Let's call the doing-it section the *Method*

Let's call what happened (when we did it) section the *Results*

Let's call the evaluating-the-experience section the *Discussion*

## Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion? IMRAD!

## Deciding if someone is trying to do something.

	- Look for the words, "want", "success", "challenge".
	- Look for difficulties mentioned.

## questions

On page 58, write a question that if answered, Yes, will show you are successful.

Write what you will do in the Method section on page 59.

# My understanding of someone else's plans to do something

## Procedure

First:

Tell the person next to you a food plan for next week.

Second:

Tell the person on the other side of you what the first person told you.


You will report what your second partner told you about her/his first partner's project.

What is the food area in which they are trying to do something?

What are they trying to do?

How will they decide if they are successful or not?

It doesn't matter if you didn't understand what your first partner said. In fact, it is better if you use your imagination. GIVE the first partner some ideas, GOALS, measures of SUCCESS.

# Cooking Research Exam--2 100-word essays

## Rubric

I WANT 

1. THE 4 HEADINGS: Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion. YOU MUST HAVE THEM. Write them at the top and write notes for each heading. Then use the headings AGAIN in the body of the essay.
2. 2 Questions in the Introduction. The answers to the 2 questions will tell us whether you were successful or not. NOT: Was it successful?, but Did the milk mixed with the wax gourd drink make it taste good but less sweet?

## Option 1--Food homework rewritten

Rewrite your food homework, with the opposite result. You were successful? Now imagine you were unsuccessful. The introduction and method will remain the same but the results and discussion will be different. The results will require your imagination, with lots of detail. In the discussion you can ANALYZE why you didn't fail, or how you can be successful next time.

## Option 2--Failed effort

Write about something you tried hard to do, but FAILED, in the last year. It must be a project whose failure you hold yourself accountable for. Eg, NOT something like failing to win the lottery. The result of a lottery is chance, and not dependent on what you do. In Method, write what you did. In the Results, describe the failure. In the Discussion, talk about why, what you could do next time, and what you think.

## Option 3--Teaching self language project

Think about a short, easy project to teach yourself some language. Not, "Teach myself German", but "Learn ten German words from the textbook next week," or "Find a foreigner and have a short conversation with him/her next week." You haven't done it yet, so Method, Results and Discussion will be imagined. 

## Reading partner's essay

Look at the essay results and discussion and say what you think the answers to their questions are. If they haven't written the results, imagine what the answers might be. And add another question that you think the essay could answer.

# Grading partner's essay

# IMRAD Exam--2 150-word essays

## Requirements

I WANT

1. THE 4 HEADINGS: Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion. YOU MUST HAVE THEM. Write them at the top and write notes for each heading. Then use the  headings AGAIN in the body of the essay.
2. 2 Questions in the Introduction. The answers to the 2 questions will tell us whether you were successful or not. NOT: Was it successful?, but Did the milk mixed with the wax gourd drink make it taste good but less sweet?

## Essay 1--Food research

Write about a food experiment. Were you successful or not? Could be a restaurant you went to, or a recipe you tried to make, or a food you tried/bought. Try to remember what happened. You MUST have an Introduction (why, with 2 questions). Method (what), Results (what happened) and Discussion (what you think, learned).  Remember this is a story about one thing that happened one time, NOT, NOT a repeated experience. Talk about repeated experiences, but the focus is on the one-time event, and on success or failure.

## Essay 2--Shopping survey

Introduction: What do you want to find out from the people you will interview? Why is this an interesting survey to carry out. Method: 3 questions, 3 answers. Who will you ask?  Results: Imagine what the people told you in answer to each question. Imagine what else they said to you. Discussion: What do the Results of the survey mean to you? Try to generalize from your specific Results to a general statement about shopping. What do you think about people and about shopping? What questions will you ask next time?

## Planned language learning action research project Week 16-17

Students wrote essays at a high, abstract level--Good

Doing language learning at a low, concrete level is also good.

For the project, think at a high level, act at a low level--Name the words, sentences, things you are going to learn
