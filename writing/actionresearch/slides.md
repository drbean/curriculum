# Trying to do something, seeing how it goes, writing about it

## Deciding if someone is trying to do something.

	- Look for the words, "want", "success", "challenge".
	- Look for difficulties mentioned.

# Writing notes in preparation for food experiment.

On page 58, write a question that if answered, Yes, will show you are successful.

Write what you will do in the Method section on page 59.

# My understanding of someone else's plans to do something

First:

Tell the person next to you a food plan for next week.

Second:

Tell the person on the other side of you what the first person told you.


You will report what your second partner told you about her/his first partner's project.

What is the food area in which they are trying to do something?

What are they trying to do?

How will they decide if they are successful or not?

It doesn't matter if you didn't understand what your first partner said. In fact, it is better if you use your imagination. GIVE the first partner some ideas, GOALS, measures of SUCCESS.
