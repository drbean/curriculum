# Trying to do something, seeing how it goes, writing about it

## Deciding if someone is trying to do something.

	- Look for the words, "want", "success", "challenge".
	- Look for difficulties mentioned.

# Writing notes in preparation for food experiment.

## questions

On page 58, write a question that if answered, Yes, will show you are successful.

Write what you will do in the Method section on page 59.

# My understanding of someone else's plans to do something

## Procedure

First:

Tell the person next to you a food plan for next week.

Second:

Tell the person on the other side of you what the first person told you.


You will report what your second partner told you about her/his first partner's project.

What is the food area in which they are trying to do something?

What are they trying to do?

How will they decide if they are successful or not?

It doesn't matter if you didn't understand what your first partner said. In fact, it is better if you use your imagination. GIVE the first partner some ideas, GOALS, measures of SUCCESS.

# Cooking Research Exam--2 100-word essays

## Rubric

I WANT 

1. THE 4 HEADINGS: Introduction, Method, Results, Discussion. YOU MUST HAVE THEM. Write them at the top and write notes for each heading. Then use the headings AGAIN in the body of the essay.
2. 2 Questions in the Introduction. The answers to the 2 questions will tell us whether you were successful or not. NOT: Was it successful?, but Did the milk mixed with the wax gourd drink make it taste good but less sweet?

## Option 1--Food homework rewritten

Rewrite your food homework, with the opposite result. You were successful? Now imagine you were unsuccessful. The introduction and method will remain the same but the results and discussion will be different. The results will require your imagination, with lots of detail. In the discussion you can ANALYZE why you didn't fail, or how you can be successful next time.

## Option 2--Failed effort

Write about something you tried hard to do, but FAILED, in the last year. It must be a project whose failure you hold yourself accountable for. Eg, NOT something like failing to win the lottery. The result of a lottery is chance, and not dependent on what you do. In Method, write what you did. In the Results, describe the failure. In the Discussion, talk about why, what you could do next time, and what you think.

## Option 3--Teaching self language project

Think about a short, easy project to teach yourself some language. Not, "Teach myself German", but "Learn ten German words from the textbook next week," or "Find a foreigner and have a short conversation with him/her next week." You haven't done it yet, so Method, Results and Discussion will be imagined. 

## Reading partner's essay

Look at the essay results and discussion and say what you think the answers to their questions are. If they haven't written the results, imagine what the answers might be. And add another question that you think the essay could answer.

## Planned language learning action research project Week 16-17

Students wrote essays at a high, abstract level--Good

Doing language learning at a low, concrete level is also good.

For the project, think at a high level, act at a low level--Name the words, sentences, things you are going to learn
