# Design

## House design

You wrote about the place you live in and what was good about it and/or what you would change

Now imagine you MADE those changes. You have the NEW PLACE you were thinking about, (or are still in the old place.)

Now, say:

* why you made (or didn't make) those changes (make up lots of details)
* whether the new place is really better, or whether it is not better
* what other alternatives you had at that time. What place could you have had instead?

	* what the advantages and disadvantages of each of the other alternatives were

* what you and your family discussed or what went through your mind as you got the NEW PLACE, or didn't get it.
