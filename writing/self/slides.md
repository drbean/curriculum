# Exam 2

## Midterm exam
# Midterm exam

Write 150 words about each topic. 

* Who am I? The problem of knowing about myself and what I can say about myself.
* Improving my EQ and using it to do good

## Who am I? The problem of knowing about myself and what I can say about myself.

You told some other students about their blind and unknown selves. Were you telling the truth? Or were you just being kind? What they told you: Was it true? Do they know you well enough to tell you who you are? Write about discovering who you really are.

### IN ADDITION:

The blind and unknown areas of our selves are bigger than the open and hidden areas. Try to remember experiences you have had that have told you things about yourself that surprised you. Write about them. Write about characteristics you, your family and others didn't know you had. Write about the person you would like to become, using qualities you didn't know you had.

## Improving my EQ and using it to do good

You wrote well about your EQ and you evaluated your EQ well. 
Now try to remember experiences that increased your EQ. Write about those experiences. 

### IN ADDITION:

Write about how you have used your EQ to help you in your own life and to help other people. Try to remember experiences and also write about things you could do now with your higher EQ to help people in the future.

For each topic: At the top of each page, write the titles listed "Unknown self" or "EQ".

Below the title, before you start writing, write notes. Chinese notes are OK. If there are no notes, your grade goes down.

Halfway through we will stand up and look at other people's exam papers.

At 7:45 we will stop and evaluate someone else's essays.

Write on every second line, ie double space.
