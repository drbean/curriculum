        ## presentation slide

        Say what you wrote for homework. But don't read it.

        ( If you didn't do the homework, think of something to say about songs.)

        Keep it simple, stupid (KISS)

        Be critical about songs and singers. Say what the good things are. Say what the *bad* things are.

        Don't just copy and paste from Wikipedia. Use your own words to say what you read, but use expressions like "According to the 'Jay Chou' article on Wikipedia" to show where your information comes from.

        Say what you think.
