There is a collection of books suitable for reading on the 5th floor in the
English Language and Literature section of the library. There are books for
American teenagers as well as the normal sort of novels.

Subject catalog: English Books to read for pleasure

There are also simplified versions of old novels in the English Language
Teaching section.

Ms Cheng, the director of the Language Center, also has a collection of 30 or
so books for American teenagers. She wants to loan them to you. There is a list
on which you can write your name when you borrow a book.

Talk to an assistant in the Language Center about borrowing one of those books.
