            Method:So we did a study plan, memorizing 10 words every morning, and testing each other before class. 
            Results:This was a very helpful way for marguerite because she had memorized her textbook. But for me there was no progress, because I had read it in the morning and forgot it at night, and I would not have memorized those words by now.
