- [study buddy ](http://www.google.com.tw/search?q=%22study+buddy%22&num=100&gws_rd=ssl&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X)

## Study goals

### 3 goals for studying for the exam

A. Make them simple goals, because you have no time.

- Don't say, Review all the material in the textbook. Say, in this writing course, for example:

        - Review the definition of IMRAD, or
        - Understand the structure of an opinion survey

B. Make them clear goals. Otherwise, they will be difficult to carry out.

- Don't say, Review the definition of IMRAD. Say, for example

        - Review what to say in each of the Introduction, Method, Results and
          Discussion.

- Don't say, Understand the structure of an opinion survey. Say,

        - Remember whether to ask a WH-question or YN-question, how many
          questions to ask, and how many people to ask.

- [From the textbook ](http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/textbook.pdf)
