# Language learning--action research

## Planned language learning action research project Week 16-17

Students wrote essays at a high, abstract level--Good

Doing language learning at a low, concrete level is also good.

For the project, think at a high level, act at a low level--Name the words, sentences, things you are going to learn

- [KISS, Keep it simple, stupid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS)
