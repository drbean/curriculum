        Use the content you find online about Taiwan, but don't just copy and paste.

        I want to hear what you think, but I also want information from sources. You need to restate what you read in your own words (otherwise it is plagiarism)! And you need to express your own opinion.

        Be warned: I CAN TELL IF SENTENCES HAVE BEEN COPIED FROM THE INTERNET!

        Use headings, for example, in an essay about the Taiwan military:

        * The effects of the Chinese Civil War on Taiwan
        * Taiwan military purchases from the US
        * Conscription
