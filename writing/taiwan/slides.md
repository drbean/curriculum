# Writing in class 3

## Comments and criticisms

I went to wikipedia to read about the movies, novels and songs you introduced. Your essays interested me in them.

But I didn't see enough headings, eg:

* Story
* Background
* Critique

# Taiwan

## What do native speakers of English know about Taiwan

- [Taiwanese exchange student asks American classmates](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuQMhhho5V8)

## Teachers of Chinese not from China

Dr Bean: a teacher of English not from America or the UK

You: teachers of Chinese not from China

We: teachers of a language from a country that is not the first country people associate with the language we teach

## A problem for our status as teachers

In Korea, a university professor said he wanted to hire a teacher who was an American.

He said an American could speak with authority about "Huckleberry Finn," which he was studying.

I said he could present an argument and we could discuss his argument.

I didn't get the job.

## What should people learning Chinese know about Taiwan

What would you want to tell people about Taiwan?

# Introducing Taiwan to people like in the video

## Your classmates are American college students

Imagine that your classmates are not studying to be Chinese teachers but are the American college students we saw in the video.

Give a 1~2 minute introduction to some aspect of Taiwan to them.

Everyone should talk about a different topic.
