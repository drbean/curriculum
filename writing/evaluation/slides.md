# Evaluation

## Peer evaluation

After you have nothing more to write about, evaluate (grade) the exam papers of other students.

If the grades you give the students are the same as Dr Bean's grades for those students, your grade for this exam will go up.

If the grades you give the students are different than Dr Bean's grades for those students, your grade will go down. The bigger the difference, the lower your grade.

Write your evaluations on the "peer evaluation" forum like this:

V05200001: johari 4

These evaluations are worth 20 percent of your grade for this exam. The other 80 percent is your 2 essays.

## How to know what grade Dr Bean will give an essay.

If there is some writing on the paper, the essay will get at least 1.

If the essay is completely off topic, eg about vacation plans, or some essay that the student has copied from somewhere else, the essay will get 2.

If the writer did not understand the topic, and did not answer the question, the essay will get 3. If the essay is OK but short, the essay will also get 3.

If the writer answered the question and wrote a lot, but the essay is not interesting, the essay will get 4. If the essay is interesting, but is short, or is not written well, because of problems with grammar, the essay will also get 4.

If the essay answers the question fully, has a lot to say, is well-written and is interesting, the essay will get 5.

## Think about

So evaluating the essays yourself, you need to think about:

* length
* interest
* answering the question
* being well-written
* originality, ie not copied from another source
