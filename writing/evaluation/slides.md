# Evaluation

## Peer evaluation

At the bottom of both exam papers, evaluate (grade) the exam paper of another student.

If the grades you give the students are the same as Dr Bean's grades for those students, your grade for this exam will go up.

If the grades you give the students are different than Dr Bean's grades for those students, your grade will go down.

Write your evaluation at the bottom like this:

V05200001: 4

Make sure the essay you are evaluating is on the same topic as the topic of YOUR essay.

These evaluations are worth 20 percent of your grade for this exam. The other 80 percent is your 2 essays.

## How to know what grade Dr Bean will give an essay.

If there is some writing on the paper, the essay will get at least 1.

If the essay is completely off topic, or some essay that the student has copied from somewhere else, the essay will get 2.

If the writer did not understand the question, and did not answer the question, the essay will get 3. If the essay is OK but short, the essay will also get 3.

If the writer answered the question and wrote a lot, but the essay is not interesting, the essay will get 4. If the essay is interesting, but is short, or is not written well, because of problems with grammar, the essay will also get 4.

If the essay answers the question fully, has a lot to say, is well-written and is interesting, the essay will get 5.

So evaluating the essays yourself, you need to think about:

* length
* interest
* answering the question
* being well-written
* copied from another source
