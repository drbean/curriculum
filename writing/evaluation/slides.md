# Evaluation

## Peer evaluation

After you have nothing more to write about, evaluate (grade) the exam papers of other students.

If the grades you give the students are the same as Dr Bean's grades for those students, your grade for this exam will go up.

If the grades you give the students are different than Dr Bean's grades for those students, your grade will go down. The bigger the difference, the lower your grade.

Write your evaluations on the "peer evaluation" forum like this:

V05200001: johari 4

These evaluations are worth 20 percent of your grade for this exam. The other 80 percent is your 2 essays.

## Summary

The essay                                     The points
--------------------------------------------  --
writing on the paper                       :  1
off-topic, copied, etc                     :  2
topic misunderstood, short, etc            :  3
not interesting, not written well, or short:  4
full answer, lot to say, interesting       :  5
--------------------------------------------  --

## 1: writing on the paper

If there is some writing on the paper, the essay will get at least 1.

## 2: off-topic, copied, etc

If the essay is completely off topic, eg about vacation plans, or some essay that the student has copied from somewhere else (like another student, or the Internet), the essay will get 2.

## 3: topic misunderstood, short, etc

If the writer did not understand the topic, and did not answer the question, the essay will get 3. If the essay is OK but short, the essay will also get 3.

## 4: not interesting, not written well, or short

If the writer answered the question and wrote a lot, but the essay is not interesting, the essay will get 4. (It shouldn't get the top grade of 5.) If the essay is interesting, but is short, or is not written well, because of problems with grammar, the essay will also get 4.

## 5: full answer, lot to say, interesting

If the essay answers the question fully, has a lot to say, is well-written and is interesting, the essay will get 5.

## Think about

So evaluating the essays yourself, you need to think about:

* length
* interest
* answering the question
* being well-written
* originality, ie not copied from another source

## Peer evaluation forum

Write lines like:

- V05200001: johari 4

- V05200010: johari 3
- V05200015: johari 1
- V05200020: diary  5

## Peer evaluation competition

For every rating inconsistent with Dr Bean's rating you get one (1) point

For every rating *consistent* with Dr Bean's rating you get two (2) points

The person with the most points gets 3 for her/his grade for the exercise.

The person with the least number of points, and who evaluated at least 10 essays, gets 2 for her/his grade. (They will have at least 10 points.)

Persons who rate less than 10 essays get from 0 to 2 for their grade.

# Writing in class AKA Exam

## Writing in class plan

I want to do 4~6 Writing in class AKA "exams" in the computer lab.

Hopefully, Week 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18

## Essay subjects

The first Writing in class AKA "exam" will be on 

1. Learning languages
2. Using Wechat, LINE, other on-line apps

## Format

I want 2 essays of at least 500 words each. (You have 2 hours for the exam)


## References

I want you to use Internet references that you can specify in advance.

For example,

"According to Wikipedia (2019), Wechat has more than one billion users."

And at the bottom of the essay,

	Wechat — Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
	[Online; accessed 16-April-2019]
	https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wechat&oldid=886030392

## Sources

Please look for on-line sources (in Chinese or English) that you might want to use during the exam.

Post them to the "Internet language learning, on-line app sources" forum

## Atmosphere

This is not a traditional exam. You can talk with other students, walk around and look at what they have written.

You cannot use phones, notes, and sources not posted in advance.
