  ## Thoughts about writing in class week 3

  * Although I told students not to copy and paste, a number of students did. I gave those students 2/5.

  * I wanted students to use the sources to give information about language and apps. But that didn't happen.

  It was good to hear students' views. They did a good job explaining their thoughts, but I wanted them to also present information (properly cited) about language and the apps.
