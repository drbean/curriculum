            .... I just got over a big hump with new high-intensity classes this past week.  Sunday I spoke on honoring one's parents - 5th commandment (I believe it went ok in the large congregation, though in the smaller 1:30 setting, some could have been pared) I wrote most of it Saturday late afternoon and arose Sun morning ~ 4:30 to complete. Ezra was my PPT guy, but there was some misunderstanding Saturday night, so when he got up ~6:15 everything wasn't put together right. Didn't get the review I wanted to do before leaving to print things out ! 7:30.
            What time did the writer get up?
          option:
            - '1:30'
            - '3:30'
            - '4:30'
            - '6:15'
            - '7:30'
            - '8:17'
            - '9:15'
            - '11:00'
          answer: '4:30'

            ... Sunday afternoon I decompressed and got up Mon @ 3:30 to put the grades together, as I was in pretty good shape already about the aspects for the grades.  Day grades were done by 8:17am, I and Ezra took the trash and recyclable to the morning drop off site and I breathed easily. By 9:15 I went back to complete Night grades as Ezra had spoken about the family going to see a movie around lunch time.  My grades were in by 11am.
            What time did the writer get up?
          option:
            - '1:30'
            - '3:30'
            - '4:30'
            - '6:15'
