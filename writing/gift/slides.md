# Exam

## giving a gift--a decision problem

Write 150 words now about a gift you GAVE. When you write, write about what the gift was and who you gave it to, but also think about why you felt you had to give the gift and whether the experience of giving the gift was a good experience. What did you say to the receiver of the gift and what did you think but not say to him/her. Also write about the choices you made at that time, not only of what the gift was, but whether to give the gift at all. What were the good/bad things about each of the alternatives?

## a good time

Let's say that good times never just happen to us. Let's say that it is our actions which result in us having a good time. Our decisions are important in whether we will have a good time or not. 

Write 150 words about some decisions you made that allowed you to enjoy life. Write about why you made these decisions and why they were good decisions. Write about what you decided NOT to do (ie an alternative to the decision you took) and what would have been the result if you had done that other thing. Write about what you said to other people and your state of mind at that time.

For example, finding a boy/girl friend, studying, choosing a career, enjoying a hobby.
