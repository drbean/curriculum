        ## Objective information + subjective impression

        Both objective information and subjective ideas are important

        You wrote well about subjective judgments, feelings and opinions, but didn't provide information last time.

        Use sources to provide information, but don't copy and paste. Use your own words to *paraphrase*.
    1:
      identifier: writing systems
      rubric: "Use the content you find online about bopomo, pinyin, Chinese characters and other writing systems, but don't just copy and paste.\n\nI want to hear what you think, but I also want information from sources. You need to restate what you read in your own words (otherwise it is plagiarism)! And you need to express your own opinion.\n\nBe warned: I CAN TELL IF SENTENCES HAVE BEEN COPIED FROM THE INTERNET!"
    2:
      identifier: travel and foreign cultures
      rubric: "Be critical about travel and foreign cultures. Say what the good things are. Say what the *bad* things are.\n\nDon't just copy and paste from Wikipedia. Use your own words to say what you read, but use expressions like \"According to the 'Korean culture' article on Wikipedia\" to show where your information comes from.\n\nSay what you think."
