* decide scenes to record on board

## 3. self as director, others as actors

Regrouping to join one of starred scenes:

* director: person responsible for scenes
* actors: persons joining director

Rehearsal by director

* director directs actors on what actions to take
* actors act following directors directions

## 4. performance for audience

Directors, actors mount stage

* director tells actors what to do
* actors do what director tells them to do
* audience appreciates performance
