% How are we to understand POSSE?

POSSE (Publish on Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere) is great. The issue is control. Not control of other people, but having what I do work or not work. On my own site, I don't need Big Tech to have a voice. And I really feel a sense of achievement getting the machine to do what I want, which contributes to the image I have of myself, my feelings of self-efficacy, which are not supported in my interactions with people, because they don't do what I want.

As a believer in #POSSE, I was motivated by https://twocanoes.com/knowledge-base/owning-it/, boosted by molly0xfff, to write scripts to post to my own site from the command line, making it as easy to do as posting a mastodon toot from the command line, and to do it at the same time.

#POSSE (Publish Own Site Syndicate Everywhere) motivated the developer at https://twocanoes.com/knowledge-base/owning-it/ to cease embedding their youtube videos on their website and instead embed them from their storage on the cloud and then also publish them on youtube independently of their website. I don't think this was #vendor_lockin by youtube, but the lack of #vendorlockin needs to be considered another of the virtues of #POSSE
