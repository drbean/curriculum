% A good theory about what we need/want/desire?

Nothing is necessary, but when you're hungry, naked and homeless in a hostile environment, you have PressingNeeds.

If those PressingNeeds are satisfied, the survival of the individual is insured (at least until the problem of OldAge, SickNess and DeatH is encountered),

The survival of the human race is not insured, unless the need/want/desire of men for ejaculation (or is it, penetration) in a woman is satisfied.

Men (ie, me) are confused about the relation of what they're doing with intimacy.
