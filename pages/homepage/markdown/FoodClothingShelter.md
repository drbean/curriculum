% On being fed, clothed and housed, what do we need/want/desire?

Nothing is necessary, but when you're hungry, naked and homeless in a hostile environment, you have PressingNeeds.

If those PressingNeeds are satisfied, the survival of the individual is insured (at least until the problem of OldAge, SickNess and DeatH is encountered),

The survival of the human race is not insured, unless the need/want/desire of men for ejaculation (or is it, penetration) in a woman is satisfied.

Speaking for all men, I say we are confused about the relation of intercourse with intimacy.

We understand sex is impossible without physical entanglement.

We don't understand the emotional entanglement, attachment, bonds that result from intercourse, and which I believe (but cannot prove) are baked in to intercourse.

I told my significant other 40 years ago that I could accept if she wanted that we stop having sex, but I asked her not to stop allowing physical intimacy.

Seeing it as an analogue to the physical tie that locks together copulating dogs helps me understand it.
