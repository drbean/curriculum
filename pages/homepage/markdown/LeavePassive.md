% 'leave' in the passive

drbean
  ~ 'The ship left the harbor', but not 'The harbor was left by the ship' 

drbean
  ~ 'His dad left him alone', and 'He was left alone by his dad.'

drbean
  ~ 'His wife left him,' but not 'He was left by his wife.'??

tinwhiskers
  ~ that one is ok

drbean
  ~ 'His wife abandoned him,' and 'He was abandoned by his wife.'??

tinwhiskers
  ~ both fine

tinwhiskers
  ~ She was abandoned by her husband?

drbean
  ~ "He left the keys/garbage on a seat' and 'The keys/garbage was/were left on a seat'.

tinwhiskers
  ~ both fine

drbean
  ~ The keys and garbage were left on a seat by a man in a black hat.'

wkalt
  ~ drbean: are you asking about correctness or style?

drbean
  ~ I'd rather not say or I don't know.

tinwhiskers
  ~ the only one I've seen so far that is really wrong is "The harbor was left by the ship"

wkalt
  ~ I think all the cases you noted above are correct, but I would say the first variants are the preferred style.

wkalt
  ~ yeah tinwhiskers that one is the oddest seeming one but I see no reason it's not correct. Usual advice is "don't use the passive voice".

tinwhiskers
  ~ and when I say wrong, I mean it's grammatically ok, but totally unnatural.

wkalt
  ~ right

drbean
  ~ 'She was abandoned by her husband,' but not, 'He was abandoned by his wife'?

wkalt
  ~ and it's nothing to do with 'leave', it really applies to any verb

drbean
  ~ 'The garbage was left by a man in a black hat' is OK, but 'The harbor was left by a ship with a black flag' is not OK?

wkalt
  ~ Neither of those are OK stylistically. Both of them are OK gramatically.

tinwhiskers
  ~ actually that makes it ok

tinwhiskers
  ~ "The harbor was left by the ship" is just very weird but "The harbor was left by a ship with a black flag" is fine.

wkalt
  ~ I wouldn't say they are weird, but both can be improved with the active voice. "The ship left the harbor", "The black-flagged ship left the harbor" are both more natural IMO.
