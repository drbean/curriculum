Going to try to commonplace book my mastodon posts first #POSSE


_08-28 12:11_ Alerted by https://bsky.app/profile/melaniemitchell.bsky.social/post/3lxcsdxrv5c26 to Eliza chatbot creator, Weizenbaum's mixed feelings about AI, I challenge his disingenousness in being disturbed by his secretary's being sucked in (?) by the bot, and asking him to leave the room. That is what he was trying to achieve with it! Perhaps she was only using it to say something about him, or to adjust her dress!



_08-28 16:28_ That is, we don't know why she asked him to leave the room. It may have had nothing to do with her interaction with the chatbot. We never hear the other side's story.



_08-28 17:29_ That said, @melaniemitchell's bringing in Weizenbaum, a chatbot creator's misgivings, like Frankenstein's horror, about what they've done, is refreshing, the other AI bros going, 'La-la-la I can't hear you.'

_08-28 22:44_ The Weizenbaum wikipedia article, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum, explains his ambivalence on AI with his distinction between deciding and choosing, a distinction I had not recognized. Deciding, being calculating, could be calculated, but choosing, could not be. Being based on values, ie, non-rationality, choice, on the basis of tasks and criteria, can only be creative human acts with consequences. Deciding and choosing, a distinction without a difference?



_08-30 17:17_ https://www.baeldung.com/linux/sed-with-string

was helpful explaining how to pipe string to sed without
using 'echo' and how pipes and process substitution
play roles.

    title="$(sed -nE "1s/^(([[:graph:]]+[[:blank:]]+){4}).*$/\1/p" <<< $story )"
    html="$(pandoc -f markdown -t html <<< $story )"
