Going to try to commonplace book my mastodon posts first #POSSE


_08-28 12:11_ Alerted by https://bsky.app/profile/melaniemitchell.bsky.social/post/3lxcsdxrv5c26 to Eliza chatbot creator, Weizenbaum's mixed feelings about AI, I challenge his disingenousness in being disturbed by his secretary's being sucked in (?) by the bot, and asking him to leave the room. That is what he was trying to achieve with it! Perhaps she was only using it to say something about him, or to adjust her dress!



_08-28 16:28_ That is, we don't know why she asked him to leave the room. It may have had nothing to do with her interaction with the chatbot. We never hear the other side's story.



_08-28 17:29_ That said, @melaniemitchell's bringing in Weizenbaum, a chatbot creator's misgivings, like Frankenstein's horror, about what they've done, is refreshing, the other AI bros going, 'La-la-la I can't hear you.'



_08-28 22:44_ The Weizenbaum wikipedia article, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum, explains his ambivalence on AI with his distinction between deciding and choosing, a distinction I had not recognized. Deciding, being calculating, could be calculated, but choosing, could not be. Being based on values, ie, non-rationality, choice, on the basis of tasks and criteria, can only be creative human acts with consequences. Deciding and choosing, a distinction without a difference?



_08-30 17:17_ https://www.baeldung.com/linux/sed-with-string

was helpful explaining how to pipe string to sed without
using 'echo' and how pipes and process substitution
play roles.

    title="$(sed -nE "1s/^(([[:graph:]]+[[:blank:]]+){4}).*$/\1/p" <<< $story )"
    html="$(pandoc -f markdown -t html <<< $story )"



_08-30 22:51_ https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/29/lossy-encyclopedia/: An encyclopedia metaphor for LLM. Mine is a bag of statements, cut up into phrases, nouns, verbs, all linked in one big tree, with all the google search keywords ever used to find the statements. We're used to google finding things on the Internet with the right search terms. This is just a step-up from that. LLM are mixing and matching statements & pushing one out. The surprising thing is that the statement is native-speaker-like text.

ジャズ・アヴァンギャルド クロニクル1967-1989著者 清水 俊彦 のタイトルが気にならない。なぜならジャズはカウンタカルチャの一つだ。アヴァンギャルドはカルチャの現象だ。カウンタカルチャの現象ではない。




_09-01  9:47_ @jensorensen@mastodon.social envisages reading AI summaries resulting in the death of the Internet. I'm not guilty of this, though out of the corner of my eye I can see google's AI overview has the answer to "input string sed" that the hits below only tease with intros like "Read ..", "Learn ..", The lesser sin I'm guilty of is scrolling through google hits to find the answer to my question, "Use a <<< here string" without having to visit sites, which may or may not have that answer.




_09-03  8:02_ Look at this Google Books comparison of frequency of "time-consuming" vs all other permutations of "time" and "consume_INF", https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=time%3D%3Econsume_INF%2Cconsume_INF%3D%3Etime&year_start=1800&year_end=2022&corpus=en&smoothing=3




_09-04 10:11_ 前にジャズ．アヴァンギャルドに日本のフリージャズが出ない理由は清水俊彦が日本人のミュージシャンを蔑視すると思った。今はかれはそういう風にした理由は「触らぬ神に祟りなし」がましだとかんがえたと思う。
