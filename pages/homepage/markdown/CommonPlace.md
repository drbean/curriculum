| 가 이거 프랑스 초콜릿이네요. 휴가 때 프랑스에 다녀 오셔나 봐요.
| 나 네, 친정어머니가 손자를 보고 싶어 하시길래 가족들과 프랑스에 다녀왔어요.
| 가 얼마 만에 고양에 가신 거였어요?
| 나 1년 만이었어요. 오래간만에 가서 그런지 부모님께서 무척 좋아하시더라고요. 간처에 사는 친척들도 우리를 본다고 왔길래 가까운 곳으로 여랭도 다녀왔어요.



_09-25  9:52_ "dir" and "mkdir" typed with the left hand one key to the right spell "fit" and "mkfit"



_09-21 16:46_ Google book hits for 'in a broader sense': [[[https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=in+a+broader+sense&year_start=1800&year_end=2022&corpus=en&smoothing=3](https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=in+a+broader+sense&year_start=1800&year_end=2022&corpus=en&smoothing=3)impressively](http](http ))monotonically increasing.



_09-21 16:23_ How did I do? The phrase, *_in a broader sense_* is used to indicate some form of hypernym/hyponym relationship and synecdoche (?), I think. It is not used to introduce a different thing which is also an exemplar of the category being discussed. There are probably animal and plant terms used this way, Eg, "cats", "big cats" and, in a broader sense, "the cat family"?



_09-21  9:59_ My attempt to use "in a broader sense":

    A "car" is a sedan or similar-styled vehicle, but the term may be used *_in a broader sense_* to refer to a wider range of vehicles, eg buses and other vehicles with more than 4 wheels, but probably not motor cycles or bicycles, as in the statement, "Many cars on the road this morning."



_09-21  9:04_ Checking google AI's response to "living breathing doll" again to see if it had a different Japanese reference this time. (It did a second time), it said:

    It sounds like you're interested in the idea of a "living breathing doll." To give you a more specific answer, I can help you find products, people, or media related to this topic. Would you like me to find out more about interactive plush toys, lifelike reborn dolls, or something else entirely?

That's unsettling. I am being stalked.

| A 오늘은 내가 살 테니까, 잘 아는 단골 초밥집에 가자.
| B 와, 정말? 꼭 스시바에 앉아서 먹어 보고 싶었는데.



_09-20 23:07_ I'm going to try to use "in a broader sense" properly and show that AI Assist was not using it properly. I may have misunderstood the point of the sentence in which it occurs. I took it to be a statement about Japanese 生人形, but actually it was probably saying life-like store window mannequins might be called "living breathing dolls".



_09-19  8:52_ Agent definitions collected at [[[https://simonwillison.net/tags/agent-definitions/](https://simonwillison.net/tags/agent-definitions/)I'm](http](http ))unhappy about term, 'agents'. [[[http://drbean.sdf.org/AgainstAgency.html](http://drbean.sdf.org/AgainstAgency.html)They](http](http ))never discuss the double meaning, [[[http://drbean.sdf.org/DuplicitousAgent.html](http://drbean.sdf.org/DuplicitousAgent.html)I'm](http](http ))afraid of the technical AI meaning tail wagging the established, real-world meaning dog.

_09-17  8:22_ I need to learn how to use readline better. It has almost 800 lines in 'man bash', around a sixth of the total 4452 lines


_09-16 21:05_

    alias arrow="echo -n → "

    $ arrow hey howdy ha

    $ echo -n $(arrow howdy hey) ha
    → howdy hey ha

    drbean@ESPRIMO ~
    $

I guess this is marginally useful for something


_09-16 20:20_ I might make a bash alias for a Unicode right arrow. I can find the code point in vim digraphs, though there are a lot to scroll through. It's probably just '->'.


_09-16 17:59_ "bash unicode typing" wasn't much use, but "mintty cygwin terminal unicode" led me to the mintty manual, where I found I didn't have the Ctrl+Shift+letter shortcut option enabled


_09-16 17:16_ Googling "bash digraphs like vim" the first line of the AI Assist answer says something about creating aliases. I want to resist reading further but the hits are unhelpful, being all about vim, not bash. I will change the search string to "bash unicode". 'man bash' only offers '\\uHHHH'. Ugh

_09-16  8:01_ I don't think Melanie Mitchell's magical thinking ([[[https://aiguide.substack.com/p/magical-thinking-on-ai)](https://aiguide.substack.com/p/magical-thinking-on-ai))and](http](http ))Murray Shanahan's roleplaying ([[[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06647-8)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-06647-8))bring](http](http ))much to the table, explaining the reaction to or the nature of LLM, but Alison Gopnik's stone soup story ([[[https://simons.berkeley.edu/news/stone-soup-ai)](https://simons.berkeley.edu/news/stone-soup-ai))is](http](http ))illuminating, inspirational because it takes LLM apart, showing users are being fooled, and *still* shows respect.

_09-15 23:07_ The reference to iki-ningyo (生人形) or ikiki-ningyo (行き来人形) is completely gratuitous, I assume included because the literal translation is "living doll". (Though, I'm wondering if the Japan reference is because google knows I'm in Japan from my IP address.). They were exhibited waxwork figures and are not mentioned in the Japanese wikipedia doll page, but are at [[[https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%94%9F%E4%BA%BA%E5%BD%A2](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%94%9F%E4%BA%BA%E5%BD%A2)The](http](http ))English wikipedia page has more gory details than the Japanese.

_09-15 ??:??_ There's much wrong with this unstable AI Assist. The 2 sentences are 2 bites at the apple, failing because they are saying essentially the same thing twice. The verbs in the 2 sentences, "describe", "seem", "refer," "possess", "be", "have", "seem", "come to life", "refer" again, "characterize" are weak verbs. Without meaningful verbs, the effect is of having a series of noun phrases hanging together grammatically, but failing to communicate semantically anything more than they would have as a list.

_09-15 13:??_ Ha. gmail is putting notifications from me as an administrator of my google blogger.com blog to me (under another id) inviting me to be a poster in my spam folder.

_09-15 10:??_ On 09-15 10:16, google AI overview returned,  "Living breathing doll" is a figurative phrase or idiom that describes a person who is exceptionally beautiful, charming, or endearing, often to the point of seeming unreal or like a perfectly crafted doll come to life. It can also refer to the "Living Doll" aesthetic, a beauty trend characterized by a hyper-feminine, doll-like appearance, and in a broader sense, can refer to life-sized, lifelike mannequins or dolls, such as the historical Japan iki-ningyō.

_09-15 9:??_ "Living breathing doll" is a song title, a later rendering of the earlier song title,  "Living doll". ddg returns "breathing doll" doll hits, but google doesn't on the first page. The first seems to be a title for a NY Post article about a Japanese robot in 2005, a second a quote from a book in 2017, and the third the song title in 2019. Given this lack of depth for the phrase, I suspect the google AI overview of the phrase is "extrapolating", or playing fast and loose with the facts.

_09-15  8:50_ My analogy for this AI hair on fire moment was Clever Hans, because people were amazed at the horse's ability to do arithmetic in German. Ny new analogy is #ventriloquism and people's amazement a dummy could be a living breathing doll.

_09-15  8:14_ An LLM is designed to generate statistically likely responses to the question "What would an answer to this query sound like?" This is not the same thing as answering the question. It might produce what you are looking for, or it might not. This is one reason why output from an LLM will sound authoritative even when it is wrong, and apologetic when mistakes are pointed out. It is not authoritative or apologetic, and it is not "thinking" about the question, says @mcnees@mastodon.social

_09-15  8:01_ I was distressed that version control was not seeing changes I made to my blog. Then I couldn't understand why the changes were appearing in the repo. Then I remembered my blogging script commits changes I make to the blog to the repo. The feeling was like wandering around, lost, for a time, and then coming across a place that seems familiar, because I've already been here. LLM hallucinations, anyone?

Walking on air, anyone?

Walking on water, anyone?

Walking on paint, anyone?

_09-11 22:36_ sponge(1) is counterintuitive. The man page says, "sponge reads standard input and writes it out to the specified file. Unlike a shell redirect, sponge soaks up all its input before writing the output file. This allows constructing pipelines that read from and write to the same file."

But this code,

    < file.txt sponge | tac > file.txt

truncates the file. This code,

    < file.txt tac | sponge file.txt

works. I don't understand. At the end doesn't seem like the right place for it. By then the file's already truncated.

In thread:

joe
wyohjoe@mastodon.sdf.org

@drbean In the first one, you're using shell redirection (the ` > file.txt`
part) to write into file.txt. All shell redirections are opened by the shell
before any of the commands are invoked, which is why file.txt gets truncated.

In your second example, you're passing file.txt as an argument to the sponge
command, and the sponge command opens the file itself, which occurs later in
processing which is why that doesn't truncate it.

_09-11  9:13_ Instead of saying, "was to have 3 children," and "would go on to have 3 sons," they should just say, "and they had 3 children"

* compositionality, Basically, the whole is the sum of the parts,
* substitutability, 'Dog bites man and man bites dog' '我愛她和她愛我' https://chineseedge.com/how-to-say-and-in-chinese/,

_09-01  9:47_ @jensorensen@mastodon.social envisages reading AI summaries resulting in the death of the Internet. I'm not guilty of this, though out of the corner of my eye I can see google's AI overview has the answer to "input string sed" that the hits below only tease with intros like "Read ..", "Learn ..", The lesser sin I'm guilty of is scrolling through google hits to find the answer to my question, "Use a <<< here string" without having to visit sites, which may or may not have that answer.

Mine is a bag of statements, cut up into phrases, nouns, verbs, all linked in one big tree, with all the google search keywords ever used to find the statements. We're used to google finding things on the Internet with the right search terms. This is just a step-up from that. LLM are mixing and matching statements & pushing one out. The surprising thing is that the statement is native-speaker-like text.

_08-28 22:44_ The Weizenbaum wikipedia article, [[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum,)explains](http](http ))his ambivalence on AI with his distinction between deciding and choosing, a distinction I had not recognized. Deciding, being calculating, could be calculated, but choosing, could not be. Being based on values, ie, non-rationality, choice, on the basis of tasks and criteria, can only be creative human acts with consequences. Deciding and choosing, a distinction without a difference?



_08-28 17:29_ That said, @melaniemitchell's bringing in Weizenbaum, a chatbot creator's misgivings, like Frankenstein's horror, about what they've done, is refreshing, the other AI bros going, 'La-la-la I can't hear you.'



_08-28 16:28_ That is, we don't know why she asked him to leave the room. It may have had nothing to do with her interaction with the chatbot. We never hear the other side's story.
