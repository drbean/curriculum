_01/04 12:16_ The well-known AI failure on word letter counts, https://www.google.com/search?q=AI+error+count+number+letter+words&udm=14 is surprising, but should not be surprising, because LLM are just generating statements and not stating truths. But people by default expect a statement to be accompanied  by a claim of truth even when coming from known liars (Trump). A foolish inconsistency is the hobgoblin of small minds.

_01/02 21:02_ The introduction of the freezer content as topic, alongside thermometers and garage-placement leads readers to expect advice about what can or can't be stored in one. The Tempe body part report information then becomes relevant, even as it shocks by taking the topic in different direction than expected.

So, how about my rewritten rewrite and my analysis of it.



_01/02 20:49_ My rewritten rewrite, `A chest freezer in Tempe, or anywhere, should ideally be set to to 0°F (-18°C) or below for safe, long-term food storage. When buying or using one, look for features like a wide temperature range, especially if placing in a garage (garage-ready models), and use an external thermometer to confirm it holds that consistent 0°F. Also consider the nature of the freezer's content. The mention of Tempe calls to mind ghastly reports of body parts found in a freezer there.`



_01/02 20:44_ My rewritten rewrite, `A chest freezer in Tempe, or anywhere, should ideally be set to to 0°F (-18°C) or below for safe, long-term food storage. When buying or using one, look for features like a wide temperature range, especially if placing in a garage (garage-ready models), and use an external thermometer to confirm it holds that consistent 0°F. The nature of the freezer's content also needs to be considered. The mention of Tempe calls to mind ghastly reports of body parts found in a freezer there.`



_01/02 20:39_ The characterization of Tempe as a place with hot summers is unnecessary.



_01/02 17:53_ My rewrite doesn't adequately motivate change of topic to body part reports.



_01/01 22:52_ My rewrite, `A chest freezer in Tempe, or anywhere with hot summers, should ideally be set to to 0°F (-18°C) or below for safe, long-term food storage. When buying or using one, look for features like a wide temperature range, especially if placing in a garage (garage-ready models), and use an external thermometer to confirm it holds that consistent 0°F. The mention of Tempe calls to mind ghastly reports of body parts found in freezers there.`



_01/01 22:04_ 5. The `that` in `that consistent 0°` in the final sentence interestingly draws attention to the 0°F mentioned in the first sentence. It could have been `a consistent 0°` as there is no mention of a need for a consistent temperature in the 1st sentence.

_12/26 22:28_ The Great Pretender in the 2 senses of liar and aspiring candidate risking all to overcome all odds and win power.

_12-16  8:22_ For "biologically-sound", or "beneficial", read "nutritious and with reduced risk of harm to health". With this definition, eating of raw animal products (including milk and eggs?) is not biologically-sound, because of the risk of parasites. The unappealing taste of raw meat (and to a lesser extent of raw fish, but not animal milk?), and all non-fresh, non-cooked thing which looks it might still be swallowable, is a word to the wise, "Don't eat it!"



_12-15 21:13_ For "biologically-sound/unsound" read "beneficial/unbeneficial"



_12-15 17:57_ What about raw meat? Eating it is, let's say, biologically-sound, because eating cooked meat is, it being nutritional. The Japanese eat raw fish, but is there any group where raw meat eating is a practice? (Apparently Inuit do) It doesn't taste good, but cooked meat does.

I want to find points in the evolution of Homo sapiens where cooking with fire and meat eating became common practices. If I can show some relationship, perhaps I can establish meat-eating became a practice after it started tasting good, because it was cooked.

Or perhaps, meat tastes evolved.

This runs up against food aversions which result in eating decisions with no nutritional benefit. And the eating of fermented foods despite "challenging" tastes.




_12-15 17:27_ Tobacco addiction goes beyond those physiological mechanisms of taste however by inducing a new substance need paralleling the need for food. This new substance need governed by the taste/smell of tobacco is biologically unsound. But can we still learn something about the role of good/bad tastes in making biologically-sound eating decisions?



_12-15  8:52_ What do the attractions of tobacco say about the physiological mechanisms by which taste governs individual nutrition decisions that are biologically sound.

Except for sugar? Or especially for sugar?

And does this suggest there are ways to combat tobacco addiction, other than adding horrible tastes to cigarettes, as that doesn't work for alcohol.

_11-27  7:59_ https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19757 argues, "Language understanding entails not just extracting the surface-level meaning of the linguistic input, but constructing rich mental models of the situation it describes."

This puts LLM in their place. But to this shallow take on language I would say, It's language all the way down.

https://www.experimental-history.com/p/secrets-of-the-ancient-memelords

I wrote something on his "study" of people imagining different consequences. They mostly imagined good or bad consequences?



_11-25 23:03_ Another plan of attack is how text is more than just the individual sentences in it.

Although LLM create grammatical sentences, does it connect them into text?

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_linguistics #text #LLM 3/?



_11-25 21:03_ Language is not just about communicating statements, but also conveying feelings and attitudes.

Those can be explicitly expressed by the speakers along with the statements or inferred by listeners reading between the lines.

Mind readers try to understand what is meant by what is said and assume there are minds behind the language, which are to be understood. #mind #language #AI 2/?

_11-25  7:50_ Dreams are different. In one, I was intrigued passing a non-native street vendor. The visuals were vague, perhaps monochrome. He called out, "What's your middle name?" He asked what 'myself' meant. Then I crossed the street.

Someone could dream that without any visual content? I am sometimes aware of color in dreams. But not touch, smells? #dream 2/2



_11-25  7:33_ Matt Glassman at https://mattglassman.substack.com/p/moderation-has-multiple-dimension talks about some recent writing on how some people lack mental imagery, so called aphantasia. He calls such differences perhaps a big unknown unknown.

Awareness of imagery differences is not new, no? Do these people hear, but see nothing, when they dream?

I see mental images, memories of places/people sometimes. They're not vivid. But when imagining things not evident, the thoughts are words. #imagery 1/2



_11-24 16:55_ Intention is also a wishy-washy notion.

A: Don't you think you should use public transport?

B: I intend to next week (but I may or may not get around to doing it.)

In the spirit of "The (checks notes) spirit is willing but the flesh is weak," intention and action are 2 different things.

That's why the post-Rubicon moment and mindsets are important.

_11-24 16:15_ There's no mind behind LLM translations from Chinese to English, so although they do a fantastic job at sentence-level syntax translation, they're lost with unspoken articles and tense distinctions conveyed from mind to mind in Chinese because the Chinese text gives them no guidance as to how to express them in text in English where they are a grammatical requirement. They can read text, but can't read minds. That's my story, anyway, and I'm sticking with it. #LLM #中文 #translation



_11-24  9:29_ Discussion of "impend/impending" frequency and collocation differences at https://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=72043#more-72043 as with "consume time/time-consuming" suggests '-ing' adjectives have a life of their own.

No cites of my examples, so no diff? For balls, sure, but "sling the door/fling the door"?, surely not.



_11-22 23:00_ "I'll get to it soon" means you better do it within 3 seconds." "better" as modal verb, anyone?

I can remember at the age of 5(?) using it in a modal verb's full range: "You better stop that, bettern't you", probably in response to my mother using "better" as a command. I stopped doing that. Did I realize it's a contraction of "had better"?

_11-20 18:10_ But who of it is said, "I/you/they couldn't see the wood for the trees!"? "I couldn't see the wood for the trees!," or "That's like being unable to see the wood for the trees!"? It's an invitation (or a notice it's time?) to flip the script?



_11-20 18:05_ I think the forest/tree idiom is used to say, "Your view's plausible, partly right, even, but wrong," with the same force as Korzybski's "the map is not the territory," and Mencken's "every complex problem has a solution that is clear, simple and wrong,"and Shakespeare's "there are more things in heaven and earth than dreamed of in your philosophy."




_11-19 17:52_ I think I was wrong about the woods/trees idiom being about not accepting what's staring you in the face, under your nose, & not putting 2+2 together, but perhaps it is about framing the problem, or getting the wrong end of the stick. It's certainly about recognizing you have a grasp of some aspects (details) of the problem, but not the most important ones (the big picture). What role does the idiom have in a conversation?



_11-19 15:10_ "see the (woods?|forest) for the trees" in google books: https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=see+the+wood+for+the+trees,see+the+woods+for+the+trees,see+the+forest+for+the+trees



_11-19  8:55_ It's used when the means to understand the problem lie under your nose, but you fail to put 2 & 2 together. Googling shows more literal interpretations, 'trapped by details,' 'too involved in a situation,' 'deep in granular details, failing to get the big picture.' Perhaps they're better. But the idea is that you have a grasp of a problem, but it is a problematic grasp? That you have a framing problem?



_11-19  8:35_ The explanation at https://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2025/Items/Nov18-1.html of the idiom, "Can't see the forest for the trees," is that in a forest, you only see individual trees, not the whole forest from an aerial view. I think it stems from a conversation with someone who doesn't understand forests.

A: See that forest over there?
B: I only see trees. It's behind the trees?
A: Oh, you can't see the forest for the trees?

The idiom captures a problematic failure to understand a problem.



_11-16 17:51_ What's the relationship between price stickiness and price elasticity in economics? The first is result of operators' unwillingness to cut prices if it means making less money? The second is users' willingness to accept that unwillingness even if it means they have less money?



_11-15  9:41_ "The program was executed on a computer equipped with an Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-10700 processor, and a Windows 11 operating system." Why should it be "the Windows 11 operating system", but not "the Intel(R) Core (TM) i7-10700 processor?" The processor is the named instance of a class that has the same nameas the instance? With the OS, an instance of a class is not the relationship involved? There are not many Windows 11 OS of which this one? See the "a Ford → Ford Company" relationship.



_11-13 20:05_ "It may be anywhere in this room," means it is somewhere in the room. But, "It may be somewhere in this room," means it may also not be in the room, ie, not anywhere in the room.

_11-12  8:56_ The problem reading this paper by authors whose first language doesn't have 'a', 'the' and plural nouns is knowing whether 'the reformulation/linearization technique' refers to one technique or a class of techniques. I don't know what a/the reformulation/linearization technique is. https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/index.php?title=Mixed-integer_linear_fractional_programming_(MILFP)#Reformulation-Linearization_Method suggests it is a specific method, but grammatical errors in the exposition there mean it might not be.

_11-08 17:37_ I think I now understand the difference between bash's login, interactive, and non-interactive shell. Non-interactive shells are not connected to stdin or stdout, whereas interactive shells are, but with limited functionality, eg /etc/profile is not read. Login shells get all the functionality bash can provide. Non-interactive shells are for scripts, interactive shells are for sub-shells and login shells are not sub-shells, but the shell you want when you login. The name's just confusing.

_11-05 13:16_ Helping a prof with the English of a Theory of Planned Behavior paper, I wrote about ways of referring to future action in English:

will is kind of used to make a public commitment,
like when making a decision and telling someone about
it, ie a Rubicon moment.

A: Don't you think you should use public transport?
B: I will use it next week.

going to is different.

A: Don't you think you should use public transport?
B: I'm going to use it next week (but I disagree it's
important to use public transport).

Present continuous with future reference is used to
show a planning and action mindset.

A: Don't you think you should use public transport?
B: I'm using it next week (I already use it and/or I agree it's
important to use public transport).

On the other hand, want is a wishy-washy way of
showing intention.

A: Don't you think you should use public transport?
B: I want to (but won't/cannot).

_09-21 16:23_ How did I do? The phrase, *_in a broader sense_* is used to indicate some form of hypernym/hyponym relationship and synecdoche (?), I think. It is not used to introduce a different thing which is also an exemplar of the category being discussed. There are probably animal and plant terms used this way, Eg, "cats", "big cats" and, in a broader sense, "the cat family"?



_09-21  9:59_ My attempt to use "in a broader sense":

    A "car" is a sedan or similar-styled vehicle, but the term may be used *_in a broader sense_* to refer to a wider range of vehicles, eg buses and other vehicles with more than 4 wheels, but probably not motor cycles or bicycles, as in the statement, "Many cars on the road this morning."

It can also refer to the "Living Doll" aesthetic, a beauty trend characterized by a hyper-feminine, doll-like appearance, and in a broader sense, can refer to life-sized, lifelike mannequins or dolls, such as the historical Japan iki-ningyō.

_09-15 9:??_ "Living breathing doll" is a song title, a later rendering of the earlier song title,  "Living doll". ddg returns "breathing doll" doll hits, but google doesn't on the first page. The first seems to be a title for a NY Post article about a Japanese robot in 2005, a second a quote from a book in 2017, and the third the song title in 2019. Given this lack of depth for the phrase, I suspect the google AI overview of the phrase is "extrapolating", or playing fast and loose with the facts.

_09-15  8:50_ My analogy for this AI hair on fire moment was Clever Hans, because people were amazed at the horse's ability to do arithmetic in German. Ny new analogy is #ventriloquism and people's amazement a dummy could be a living breathing doll.

_09-15  8:14_ An LLM is designed to generate statistically likely responses to the question "What would an answer to this query sound like?" This is not the same thing as answering the question. It might produce what you are looking for, or it might not. This is one reason why output from an LLM will sound authoritative even when it is wrong, and apologetic when mistakes are pointed out. It is not authoritative or apologetic, and it is not "thinking" about the question, says @mcnees@mastodon.social

_09-15  8:01_ I was distressed that version control was not seeing changes I made to my blog. Then I couldn't understand why the changes were appearing in the repo. Then I remembered my blogging script commits changes I make to the blog to the repo. The feeling was like wandering around, lost, for a time, and then coming across a place that seems familiar, because I've already been here. LLM hallucinations, anyone?

_09-11 22:36_ sponge(1) is counterintuitive. The man page says, "sponge reads standard input and writes it out to the specified file. Unlike a shell redirect, sponge soaks up all its input before writing the output file. This allows constructing pipelines that read from and write to the same file."

But this code,

    < file.txt sponge | tac > file.txt

truncates the file. This code,

    < file.txt tac | sponge file.txt

works. I don't understand. At the end doesn't seem like the right place for it. By then the file's already truncated.

In thread:

@drbean In the first one, you're using shell redirection (the ` > file.txt`
part) to write into file.txt. All shell redirections are opened by the shell
before any of the commands are invoked, which is why file.txt gets truncated.

In your second example, you're passing file.txt as an argument to the sponge
command, and the sponge command opens the file itself, which occurs later in
processing which is why that doesn't truncate it.

_09-11  9:13_ Instead of saying, "was to have 3 children," and "would go on to have 3 sons," they should just say, "and they had 3 children"

I had my breakfast when she woke up. She became mad that I had my breakfast.

In the first she is mad because he already ate while she was still sleeping (she now has to eat by herself). In the second she is mad because he is now eating (maybe they agreed on a diet the night before).

_09-08 10:22_ she, where I had had 'had', had had 'had had'. 'Had had' had been advised, and 'had had' had been chosen.



_09-08 10:00_ qutebrowser history to the rescue! I read the characterization of language as compositional, systematic, productive in https://aiguide.substack.com/p/an-ai-breakthrough-on-systematic that I probly found in https://aiguide.substack.com/p/do-half-of-ai-researchers-believe. But where I had 'subsitutability', https://melaniemitchell.me/ had 'systematicity'. I stand by my choice.

_09-07 17:18_ I just saw this, but can't recall where, Distinguishing characteristics of language:

* compositionality, Basically, the whole is the sum of the parts,
* substitutability, 'Dog bites man and man bites dog' '我愛她和她愛我' https://chineseedge.com/how-to-say-and-in-chinese/,
* productivity, You can say anything with language.

They forgot grammaticality? Or did they.

_09-01  9:47_ @jensorensen@mastodon.social envisages reading AI summaries resulting in the death of the Internet. I'm not guilty of this, though out of the corner of my eye I can see google's AI overview has the answer to "input string sed" that the hits below only tease with intros like "Read ..", "Learn ..", The lesser sin I'm guilty of is scrolling through google hits to find the answer to my question, "Use a <<< here string" without having to visit sites, which may or may not have that answer.

_08-30 22:51_ https://simonwillison.net/2025/Aug/29/lossy-encyclopedia/: An encyclopedia metaphor for LLM. Mine is a bag of statements, cut up into phrases, nouns, verbs, all linked in one big tree, with all the google search keywords ever used to find the statements. We're used to google finding things on the Internet with the right search terms. This is just a step-up from that. LLM are mixing and matching statements & pushing one out. The surprising thing is that the statement is native-speaker-like text.



_08-30 17:17_ https://www.baeldung.com/linux/sed-with-string

was helpful explaining how to pipe string to sed without
using 'echo' and how pipes and process substitution
play roles.

_08-28 22:44_ The Weizenbaum wikipedia article, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum, explains his ambivalence on AI with his distinction between deciding and choosing, a distinction I had not recognized. Deciding, being calculating, could be calculated, but choosing, could not be. Being based on values, ie, non-rationality, choice, on the basis of tasks and criteria, can only be creative human acts with consequences. Deciding and choosing, a distinction without a difference?



_08-28 17:29_ That said, @melaniemitchell's bringing in Weizenbaum, a chatbot creator's misgivings, like Frankenstein's horror, about what they've done, is refreshing, the other AI bros going, 'La-la-la I can't hear you.'



_08-28 16:28_ That is, we don't know why she asked him to leave the room. It may have had nothing to do with her interaction with the chatbot. We never hear the other side's story.




_08-28 12:11_ Alerted by https://bsky.app/profile/melaniemitchell.bsky.social/post/3lxcsdxrv5c26 to Eliza chatbot creator, Weizenbaum's mixed feelings about AI, I challenge his disingenousness in being disturbed by his secretary's being sucked in (?) by the bot, and asking him to leave the room. That is what he was trying to achieve with it! Perhaps she was only using it to say something about him, or to adjust her dress!
