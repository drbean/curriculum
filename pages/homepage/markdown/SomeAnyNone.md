% There is `some difference or no difference,` but not `any difference`

### What is the difference?

How to account for the difference in use of `some X` and `any X`? Both seem to refer to members of the X set without identifying them, but `some X` implies `X` which are of interest exist, while `any X` doesn't[^1].

I think there is a parallel with `a X` and `the X`. `Some X` and `any X` don't identify the members of the X set which are of interest, but `a X` and `the X` do. `The X` implies that the identified member of the set of `X`s is already considered a member of the different(?) set of topics under discussion. `A/an` introduces that member to that set.

This difference between `a X` and `the X` can be described perhaps as

- creating, realizing, asserting, emphasizing, embracing, focusing and introducing the `X` set member, *or*
- not creating, not realizing, not asserting, not emphasizing, not embracing, not focusing, and not introducing that member?

Lets call this difference *instantiating*. An instance of X, a member of the X set is posited.

The same difference describes the relationship between `some` and `any`?

### Analysis of some naturally-occurring examples

#### Calling on students

Ben Stein according to
[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/03/04/ferris-bueller-tariffs-scene-trump/81336305007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/03/04/ferris-bueller-tariffs-scene-trump/81336305007/)
sought a student response, with, `Anyone? Anyone?`.

In a class, I would say, `Someone? Anyone? No one?` The first with the expectation there would be a response, the second without that expectation, the third with the expectation that there would be no response.

#### When somewhere and anywhere are different places

The difference between `somewhere` and `anywhere` is discussed at
[https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/19364/difference-between-somewhere-and-anywhere/19371#19371](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/19364/difference-between-somewhere-and-anywhere/19371#19371)
with the examples, 

            “It may be anywhere in this room,”

(but not. “* It is anywhere in this room,” )

and

            “It may be somewhere in this room,”

##### Scenarios explaining the somewhere/anywhere difference

When would these 2 different sentences be used?

Consider the scenario of a search being carried out of a room for something which is believed to be in the room, but which is not immediately visible, creating a problem. For example, the FBI goes to Mar-a-Lago and enters Trump's office looking for a letter from Kim Jong-un, or in an
[evil maid attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_maid_attack)
a Saudi spy enters Jeff Bezos' hotel room to plant malware on his phone while he is with Lauren Sanchez in another room in the hotel. Both the FBI and the Saudi spy believe what they're looking for is in the room, but that they're going to have to search everywhere in the room to find it. They say, expressing the problem they face,

            “It may be anywhere in this room,”

meaning it is in the room, somewhere in the room, but that they don't know where in the room, and that this is a problem.

Now suppose the FBI and the Saudi spy aren't able to find what they're looking for. The FBI has information Trump has stored boxes in a bathroom, and the Saudi spy realizes there is a second room in Bezos' hotel suite. So, they go to this second place, and say, expressing hope they will find what they're looking for in this other room,

            “It may be somewhere in this room,”

But this doesn't mean they believe it is in the room. It means they know it may also not be in the room, ie, not anywhere in the room, but that it is possible they may find it if they look everywhere in the room.

##### Analysis of difference

Tricky. In interaction with the modal `may`, `some/any` refer to unspecified possible places in some space to communicate different interpretations of this inability to specify place.

#### Drawing conclusions leaving details unspecified 

Scene: A car at the bottom of a cliff, with blood splattered everywhere

    Bystander: Was there anyone in the car?
    Police: No, Einstein.

    Bystander: Someone was in the car?
    Police: Yes, Sherlock.

In the first case, the police sarcastically give a false answer because `Einstein` should have expected the answer would be `yes`.

In the second case, the police's `Yes` answer is not sarcastic, but calling them `Sherlock` disparages their powers of observation, because `Sherlock`'s tentativeness using a question to hedge their conclusion is unwarranted.

#### Unresponsiveness to the distinction

After the bystanders, students from a detective academy arrive on a field trip.

    Instructor: It is your task to learn about the occupants of the car.

    Do you use someone or anyone.

    Someone? Anyone?

    Students: [crickets]

#### The distinction in requests

To a first approximation, `some` is OK mostly everywhere, but `any` only in negative statements, modal and conditional clauses and questions, ie not in positive statements.

And in
[https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin/2026-January/259210.html](https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin/2026-January/259210.html), a response to a bug report:

    Thanks for the report and the test case.  I looked into the issue and found the cause. I also confirmed that the patch attached solves the issue.

    Could anyone please review the patch?

`anyone` is in a question, but it should be,

    Could someone please review the patch?

or

    Could people please review the patch?


Why is that? On the other hand,

    Does anyone want to review the patch?

is OK, because the answer is `Yes/No`. The answer to the first question is different. It's `OK/Sorry`. The first question is a request and expresses hope/expectation, so `anyone` is not OK?

`Could X please ..` puts X on notice they are being requested to do something, and you can't make a request if you aren't putting anyone on notice. Using `anyone` is not putting anyone on notice?

[^1]: `some` isn't formal? I always change `some` to a `a number of`, editing academic papers.
