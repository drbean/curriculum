% There is `some difference or no difference,` but not `any difference`

### What is the difference?

How to account for the difference in use of `some X` and `any X`? Both seem to refer to members of the X set without identifying them, but `some` implies those members which are of interest exist, while `any` doesn't[^1].

I think there is a parallel with `a` and `the`. `Some` and `any` don't identify members, but `a` and `the` do. `The` implies that the identified member is already considered a member of the (different?) set of topics under discussion. `A/an` introduces that member to that set.

This difference between `a` and `the` can be described perhaps as

- creating, realizing, asserting, emphasizing, focusing and introducing, *or*
- not creating, not realizing, not asserting, not emphasizing, not focusing, and not introducing?

The same difference describes the relationship between `some` and `any`?

+-------------------+-------------+-----------------+
| \                 | identifying | not identifying |
+===================+=============+=================+
| **asserting**     | a           | some            |
+-------------------+-------------+-----------------+
| **not asserting** | the         | any             |
+-------------------+-------------+-----------------+

### Analysis of naturally-occurring examples

#### Calling on students

Ben Stein according to
[https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/03/04/ferris-bueller-tariffs-scene-trump/81336305007/](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2025/03/04/ferris-bueller-tariffs-scene-trump/81336305007/)
sought a student response, with, `Anyone? Anyone?`.

In a class, I would say, `Someone? Anyone? No one?` The first with the expectation there would be a response, the second without that expectation, the third with the expectation that there would be no response.

#### When somewhere and anywhere are different places

The difference between `somewhere` and `anywhere` is discussed at
[https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/19364/difference-between-somewhere-and-anywhere/19371#19371](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/19364/difference-between-somewhere-and-anywhere/19371#19371)
with the example, 

            “It may be anywhere in this room,”

but not.

            “# It is anywhere in this room,”

means it is in the room, somewhere in the room. But,

            “It may be somewhere in this room,”

doesn't mean it is in the room. It means it may also not be in the room, ie, not anywhere in the room.

Tricky. In interaction with the modal `may`, `some/any` are deciding there are different possible places from which one is to be chosen for focus.

#### Drawing conclusions leaving details unspecified 

Scene: A car at the bottom of a cliff, with blood splattered everywhere

    Bystander: Was there anyone in the car?
    Police: No, Einstein.

    Bystander: Someone was in the car?
    Police: Yes, Sherlock.

In the first case, the police sarcastically give a false answer because `Einstein` should have expected the answer would be `yes`.

In the second case, the police's `Yes` answer is not sarcastic, but calling them `Sherlock` disparages their powers of observation, because `Sherlock`'s tentativeness using a question to hedge their conclusion is unwarranted.

#### Unresponsiveness to the distinction

After the bystanders, students from a detective academy arrive on a field trip.

    Instructor: It is your task to learn about the occupants of the car.

    Do you use someone or anyone.

    Someone? Anyone?

    Students: [crickets]

#### The distinction in requests

To a first approximation, `some` is OK mostly everywhere, but `any` only in negative statements, modal and conditional clauses and questions, ie not in positive statements.

And in
[https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin/2026-January/259210.html](https://cygwin.com/pipermail/cygwin/2026-January/259210.html), a response to a bug report:

    Thanks for the report and the test case.  I looked into the issue and found the cause. I also confirmed that the patch attached solves the issue.

    Could anyone please review the patch?

`anyone` is in a question, but it should be,

    Could someone please review the patch?

or

    Could people please review the patch?


Why?

    Does anyone want to review the patch?

is OK, because the answer is `Yes/No`, but the answer to the first question is `OK/Sorry`. It is a request and expresses hope/expectation, so `anyone` is not OK?

`Could X please ..` puts X on notice they are being requested to do something, and you can't make a request if you aren't putting anyone on notice. Using `anyone` is not putting anyone on notice?

[^1]: `some` isn't formal? I always change `some` to a `a number of`, editing academic papers.
