% Korean/expat teachers fail to see eye-to-eye

In the late 1980s or early 1990s, Oryang Kwon published (in a KOTESOL/AETK publication?), a piece[^praise] in praise of expat language teachers who went the extra mile, who went above and beyond the call of duty in their availability to students and their efforts to help their students learn English. At the end of the article, he hoped that every foreign teacher could be like this.

In a subsequent issue[^attack], Carol Kim[^carolkim] attacked the article, citing the inordinateness, the unreasonableness of doing what Prof Kwon was suggesting foreign teachers do, even though this was kind of beside the point, because that was actually what he was saying, that teachers were doing more than could be expected from them.

Anyway, the attack set off a storm (a flurry?) of responses[^responses] in support of the two parties and an accompanying discussion of expectations of expat teachers and Korean students[^expectations].

I don't think anyone understood what her motivation for the attack was. I guess it came as an unpleasant surprise to Prof Kwon[^Jack Large said he must be scratching his head]. I thought she was attacking Prof Kwon for venturing to characterize the work of the foreign teacher. Anyway this was the impression I think she made on readers, saying, impolitely expressed, Don't tell me what to do. But although the effect of the piece was to push back at the notion foreign teachers are only in Korea at the pleasure of their hosts, I don't think this was her intention in writing.

John Holstein, editor of the AETK Newsletter, published his own piece, arguing for a misunderstanding of Prof Kwon's hope that every teacher could be like this. In the issue after Carol Kim's attack, Jack Large said it had been his idea, not Prof Kwon's, to use the word, 'expectation' in the title to the article. Such wording would have encouraged such a misinterpretation. But I think if it was a misunderstanding, it was a willful misunderstanding. Hoping is not expecting. There was no ambiguity. Prof Kwon was hoping, not expecting.

Subsequently, argument around the point morphed into a discussion about expectations.

`Expect` is polysemous. Expectations can be desired outcomes, or hopes, as in 'lowered expectations', as well as things other people are expected to do. Teachers expect (ie, require) students to do homework, but also expect (ie, predict) some won't do homework. If you're expecting, you're pregnant. And if you're expecting guests for dinner, you're not just hoping they turn up, or expecting them to turn up,you *know* they're going to turn up, and they know you're waiting for them.

`Wish` is also polysemous. If you wish it would stop raining, you expect it won't stop raining, but if you wish someone a Merry Christmas, you're *not* expecting them not to have a good Christmas.

If you hope it stops raining, you expect there is some chance of it stopping, but if you expect it to stop raining, you think there is only some chance it will *not* stop raining.

Talking with him later, I reminded him of the saying, 
Your wish is my command
He said that if he had thought of it, he would have used it.

The context is different. The genie's role is to do the impossible and is not really misinterpreting the wish of . In this case,

I like to think she was operating at another level. I don't think she wanted to argue about what teachers should be doing, as much as to engage seriously in intercultural communication.  exemplifying the Tony Jones Principle of Intercultural Communication (and Dr Bean Principle of InterPersonal Communication) that intentions, motivations and feelings are never aligned.

Some time after, Prof Kwon told me his article had been reprinted in a TESOL Interest Section newsletter, probably the TEFL IS one.

[^praise]: The article was actually printed in the December 1991 issue of the *AETK Newsletter*, according to the following responses, but this issue is not archived at

This is kind of convenient as it allows us to read into it our own interpretations of the incident, like a crystal ball. Such is the case in many controversies, where combatants argue past each other.

	For example, I don't remember Prof Kwon having suggestions/advice for expat teachers in the article. I don't think I was present at the original keynote address at the October 1991 KATE conference, or at least I've forgotten it, although I made efforts to attend all KATE conferences.

[^carolkim]: I knew Carol Kim, but not very well. She must have been married to a Korean man, because she didn't look Korean. I never talked to her about her piece. She once said if she hadn't become a teacher, she would have been a secretary, implying teaching as a career was a worthwhile occupation.

	She probably was the kind of teacher Prof Kwon was writing about. When she left Korea to teach at Boise State University some time after, she arranged an interview for me at Inha University. I guess she didn't want to leave Inha in the lurch. But one of the professors said he was looking for someone who could speak with authority about *The Adventures of Tom Sawyer*. 

	In recent years I have tried searching the Internet for what became of her, but never turned anything up. Good keywords for her are hard to find.

Tony Jones was the Director of Studies at the British Council in the early/mid 1990's, responsible for its ELT program. I had a good relationship with him. He gave a talk to the AETK/KOTESOL Seoul chapter, but he never became involved in AETK/KOTESOL. He didn't think the KOTESOL name was a good idea.

Tony Jones' Principle of Intercultural Communication was his mock-academic, semi-humorous observation about the inability of people with different backgrounds to understand each other's intentions, motivations and feelings, despite the appearance communication is taking place smoothly. It's impossible for people from different cultures to understand each other, because intentions, motivations and feelings are never aligned.

I think the problem is not just limited to intercultural communication. Even for people in familial relationships, intentions, motivations and feelings are never aligned, despite the perception we are all on the same page. Most clearly these perceptions are a mistake when communicating interculturally,  but they are equally illusional interacting with people we are close with.
