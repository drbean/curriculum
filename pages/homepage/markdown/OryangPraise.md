In the late 1980s or early 1990s, Oryang Kwon published (in a KOTESOL/AETK publication?), a piece in praise of expat language teachers who went the extra mile, who went above and beyond the call of duty in their availability to students and their efforts to help their students learn English. At the end of the article, he hoped that every foreign teacher could be like this.

In the April 1992 issue, of the AETK Newsletter
Vol. 11 No.2

In a subsequent issue, Carol Kim attacked the article, citing the inordinateness, the unreasonableness of doing what Prof Kwon was suggesting foreign teachers do, even though this was kind of beside the point, because that was actually what he was saying, that teachers were doing more than could be expected from them.

I don't think anyone understood what her motivation for the attack was. I thought she was attacking Prof Kwon for venturing to characterize the work of the foreign teacher. Anyway this was the impression I think she made on readers, saying, impolitely expressed, Don't tell me what to do. But although the effect of the piece was to push back at the notion foreign teachers are only in Korea at the pleasure of their hosts, I don't think this was her intention in writing.

John Holstein, editor of the AETK Newsletter, published his own piece, arguing for a misunderstanding of Prof Kwon's hope that every teacher could be like this. In the issue after Carol Kim's attack, Jack Large said it had been his idea, not Prof Kwon's, to use the word, 'expectation' in the title to the article. Such wording would have encouraged such a misinterpretation. But I think if it was a misunderstanding, it was a willful misunderstanding. Hoping is not expecting. There was no ambiguity. Prof Kwon was hoping, not expecting.

'Expect' is polysemous. Expectations can be desired outcomes, or hopes, as in 'lowered expectations', as well as things other people are expected to do. Teachers expect students to do homework, but also expect some won't do homework. If you're expecting, you're pregnant. And if you're expecting guests for dinner, you're not just hoping they turn up, or expecting them to turn up,you *know* they're going to turn up, and they know you're waiting for them.

Talking with him later, I reminded him of the saying, 
Your wish is my command
He said that if he had thought of it, he would have used it.

The context is different. The genie's role is to do the impossible and is not really misinterpreting the wish of . In this case,

I like to think she was operating at another level. I don't think she wanted to argue about what teachers should be doing, as much as to engage seriously in intercultural communication.  exemplifying the Tony Jones Principle of Intercultural Communication (and Dr Bean Principle of InterPersonal Communication) that intentions, motivations and feelings are never aligned.

Some time after, Prof Kwon told me his article had been reprinted in a TESOL Interest Section newsletter, probably the TEFL IS one.

I knew Carol Kim, but not very well. She must have been married to a Korean man, because she didn't look Korean. I never talked to her about her piece. She once said if she hadn't become a teacher, she would have been a secretary, implying teaching as a career was a worthwhile occupation. She probably was the kind of teacher Prof Kwon was writing about. When she left Korea to teach at Boise State University, she arranged an interview for me at Inha University. I guess she didn't want to leave Inha in the lurch. But one of the professors said he was looking for someone who could speak with authority about The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. 

In recent years I have tried searching the Internet for what became of her, but never turned anything up. Good keywords for her are hard to find.

Tony Jones was the Director of Studies at the British Council in the early/mid 1990's, responsible for its ELT program. I had a good relationship with him. He gave a talk to the AETK/KOTESOL Seoul chapter, but he never became involved in AETK/KOTESOL. He didn't think the KOTESOL name was a good idea.

Tony Jones' Principle of Intercultural Communication was his mock-academic, semi-humorous observation about the difficulty people with different backgrounds have understanding each other's intentions, motivations and feelings. It's impossible for people from different cultures to understand each other, because intentions, motivations and feelings are never aligned.

I think the problem is not just limited to intercultural communication. Even for people in familial relationships, intentions, motivations and feelings are never aligned, despite the perception we are all on the same page. Most clearly these perceptions are a mistake when communicating interculturally,  but they are equally illusional interacting with people we are close with.
