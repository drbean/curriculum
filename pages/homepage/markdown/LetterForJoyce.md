| Not just a pretty face, Joyce has |                                   |
| the English skills to match her   |                                   |
| looks. In particular, it is her   |                                   |
| listening ability that struck me  |                                   |
| most, and her willingness to      |                                   |
| check with me when she didn\'t    |                                   |
| understand.                       |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Overall, her grades were always   |                                   |
| in the top half of the class, if  |                                   |
| not at the very top of the class, |                                   |
| especially in conversation and    |                                   |
| listening. In composition, she    |                                   |
| was also able, and her grades in  |                                   |
| this subject were good too,       |                                   |
| although not outstanding.         |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I can\'t say that I know her very |                                   |
| well, seeing as we were teacher   |                                   |
| and student, but she was always   |                                   |
| cheerful throughout the two years |                                   |
| she was in my class. She always   |                                   |
| struck me as confident without    |                                   |
| being cocky, positive without     |                                   |
| being aggressive, and friendly    |                                   |
| without being forward.            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Altogether she made a most good   |                                   |
| impression.                       |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I remember one time when I became |                                   |
| upset because some low-ability    |                                   |
| students did not have the skills  |                                   |
| or the courage to answer          |                                   |
| questions in a class discussion,  |                                   |
| even though they appeared to want |                                   |
| to. She came up to me after class |                                   |
| and said, Don\'t be sad. It makes |                                   |
| us sad too.                       |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I believe these English skills    |                                   |
| and her inter-personal skills     |                                   |
| ready her to take on any          |                                   |
| challenge she sets her mind to,   |                                   |
| either academically or in the     |                                   |
| workplace, if she is willing to   |                                   |
| apply herself to it.              |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| So, I have no hesitation in       |                                   |
| recommending her for any position |                                   |
| she seeks.                        |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I wish her good luck.             |                                   |
