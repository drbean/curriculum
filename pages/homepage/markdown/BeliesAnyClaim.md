reports prosecutors saying:

'The transcript of Ms. DiCioccio's first interview, which was produced to the defense in June 2022, belies any claim that the government only informed her of her potential criminal liability after..'

'The transcript ... belies the government only informing her of her potential criminal liability after ..'

or:

'The transcript is inconsistent with any claim that the government only informed her of her potential criminal liability after ..'
