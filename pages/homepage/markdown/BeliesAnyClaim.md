% belie: It's not used that way

[https://www.emptywheel.net/2022/12/13/witnessing-the-proud-boys/](https://www.emptywheel.net/2022/12/13/witnessing-the-proud-boys/)
reports prosecutors saying:

`The transcript of Ms. DiCioccio:s first interview, which was produced to the defense in June 2022, belies any claim that the government only informed her of her potential criminal liability after..`

I think they should have said:

`The transcript ... belies the government only informing her of her potential criminal liability after ..`

or:

`The transcript is inconsistent with any claim that the government only informed her of her potential criminal liability after ..`

The 3rd sense of the
[wiktionary 'belie'](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/belie)

A synonym is
['give the lie to'](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/give_the_lie_to#English),
though the wiktionary example there has as object a speech act, rather than a putative real-life event.

Perhaps I am wrong and the prosecutors's use of the word is not incorrect.
