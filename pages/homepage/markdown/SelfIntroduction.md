| I dropped out of a PhD in         |                                   |
| Experimental Psychology to do     |                                   |
| something in music, but when I    |                                   |
| got to Japan to study Japanese    |                                   |
| music, I found learning Japanese  |                                   |
| and teaching English was more     |                                   |
| interesting.                      |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I had studied French in high      |                                   |
| school, and in comparison with    |                                   |
| math, physics, chemistry and      |                                   |
| English, I thought French was a   |                                   |
| non-subject.                      |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| However I was interested in       |                                   |
| language, using French to read    |                                   |
| French music magazines, and       |                                   |
| teaching myself some German to    |                                   |
| read about music in German.       |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I had also lived with an          |                                   |
| Aboriginal tribe in North         |                                   |
| Australia, but because they had   |                                   |
| mostly stopped using the native   |                                   |
| language (they could be regarded  |                                   |
| as having English as a First      |                                   |
| Language, or mother tongue), I    |                                   |
| learned only a few words from the |                                   |
| native language that they         |                                   |
| continued to use.                 |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| So the effect of immersion in a   |                                   |
| second language had a big effect  |                                   |
| on me.                            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Trying to recreate this           |                                   |
| experience in Korea, where I went |                                   |
| to learn a Korean vertical flute, |                                   |
| the 短簫, to learn the Korean     |                                   |
| language, and to teach English, I |                                   |
| found myself gradually becoming a |                                   |
| full-time English teacher.        |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I had never had much respect for  |                                   |
| teachers. They talk *at* you,     |                                   |
| rather than *to* you.             |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|     I threw the ball to the dog.  |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| versus                            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
|     I threw the rock at the dog.  |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| This establishes a power          |                                   |
| differential, as with parents,    |                                   |
| but they are closer to you.       |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I did like math and I thought the |                                   |
| math teacher did a good job.      |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| But ..                            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Teaching was very interesting. I  |                                   |
| was able to observe in others to  |                                   |
| varying degrees the same          |                                   |
| experiences I had had learning my |                                   |
| languages.                        |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| This was very exciting. I         |                                   |
| regarded teaching as some form of |                                   |
| performance, conceptual art. It   |                                   |
| is all happening in the mind!     |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| But after 12 years in Korea, I    |                                   |
| decided I had to make the break   |                                   |
| and get out, or I never would. I  |                                   |
| wanted to learn Chinese. The      |                                   |
| relationship between Chinese and  |                                   |
| Korean and Japanese was very      |                                   |
| interesting to me, because it     |                                   |
| mirrors the relationship now      |                                   |
| between English and the languages |                                   |
| of East Asia.                     |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| So I came to Taiwan. However by   |                                   |
| this time the rise of the         |                                   |
| Internet had sparked an interest  |                                   |
| in computers. In Taiwan I         |                                   |
| transferred my affections from    |                                   |
| natural language to artificial    |                                   |
| computer languages.               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I spend very little time on       |                                   |
| learning Chinese and most of my   |                                   |
| time on trying to program in      |                                   |
| perl. See                         |                                   |
| [ComputerProgramming][1]          |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| [1]: ComputerProgramming.html     |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| However I am still interested in  |                                   |
| the process of language learning  |                                   |
| and I still regard myself as a    |                                   |
| good language learner. I am less  |                                   |
| interested in knowing whether I   |                                   |
| am good at Chinese or not, and    |                                   |
| what level of Chinese I have      |                                   |
| reached.                          |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Teaching in Taiwan has been a     |                                   |
| challenge. In Korea I taught      |                                   |
| company and university classes.   |                                   |
| Here I have been teaching slow,   |                                   |
| mostly-unmotivated learners. But  |                                   |
| I like a challenge. See           |                                   |
| [ChinMin](ChinMin.html).          |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| When I first got here, in 1999, I |                                   |
| wanted to present the idea that   |                                   |
| learning is an experiment, the    |                                   |
| idea of the Learner as            |                                   |
| Researcher, to my students. They  |                                   |
| didn\'t understand what I was     |                                   |
| talking about.                    |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I gave up.                        |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| This year, however, 10 years      |                                   |
| later, in my composition classes, |                                   |
| I have found myself returning to  |                                   |

| teaching each other listening     |                                   |
| strategies, I have successfully   |                                   |
| gotten my students to attempt to  |                                   |
| research their own learning and   |                                   |
| write it up.                      |                                   |

| My teaching has never been this   |                                   |
| good! I feel like I am at the     |                                   |
| peak of my career.                |                                   |

| I like the feeling that there     |                                   |
| remain teaching activities to     |                                   |
| discover. Just like someone       |                                   |
| discovered Tetris, a game that    |                                   |
| hooked into people\'s enjoyment   |                                   |
| in getting objects to fit, I      |                                   |
| think we can also discover new    |                                   |
| activities that hook into         |                                   |
| people\'s desire to understand a  |                                   |
