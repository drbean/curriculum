% My response to Chengkung University's questions for editors

Chengkung University offers an academic editing service for researchers wishing to publish their papers in English. I don't know if researchers not affiliated with the school can use it.

It has a number of English editors available to researchers, and to allow researchers to choose a particular editor, it has a questionnaire with the answers of the editors. I'm not one of their editors, but I think the questions are good so here is my response here.

Text format

:	I will edit text in any format, and usually people send me MS Word documents. My preferences are (in order):

1. plain text or markdown in a .txt or .md file
2. latex in a .tex file
3. Microsoft word format in a .docx or .doc file

When editing, I export the text from .docx files into markdown format using pandoc, edit the markdown with vim and then import (actually, copy and paste) it back into the .docx file. This reconstruction of the .docx file is laborious, so I appreciate it when someone is flexible about the formatting of the file I send back.
