| I\'ve started working in a        |                                   |
| self-access center where students |                                   |
| can make appointments for help    |                                   |
| with writing and other questions  |                                   |
| or just to talk. I\'m afraid I\'m |                                   |
| going be more available than      |                                   |
| \"availed of.\"                   |                                   |

| \[Aside: Is that a grammatical    |                                   |

| \'Avail oneself of an             |                                   |
| opportunity\' is a formal         |                                   |
| expression meaning \'make use of  |                                   |
| an opportunity\', but I don\'t    |                                   |
| know if you can use it in the     |                                   |

| Conveniently (or strategically),  |                                   |
| there is a sofa outside the       |                                   |
| department office. I have already |                                   |
| found that it is possible to      |                                   |
| \"accost\" passers-by there. I\'m |                                   |
| not really accosting them.        |                                   |
| Actually, I\'m just saying a      |                                   |
| friendly \'Hello.\'               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I hereby resolve to sit on the    |                                   |
| sofa outside the department       |                                   |
| office at 9 am and 11 am, and at  |                                   |
| 3:30 pm and 5:30 pm. And to go    |                                   |
| out of my way to strike up        |                                   |
| conversations, by saying          |                                   |
| \'Hello\' et cetera, on the way   |                                   |
| to work.                          |                                   |

| UPDATE: I am not sitting on the   |                                   |
| sofa outside the department       |                                   |

| to anyone who will look at me.    |                                   |
