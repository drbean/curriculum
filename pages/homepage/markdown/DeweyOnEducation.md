How did Dewey make education, which is a very boring subject, into something which seems so interesting?

John Dewey. The relation of theory to practice in education (1904)

The considerable persuasive power of this essay comes instead from a heady mixture
of vivid imagery and plain thinking, permeated by a sweeping theory of human thought
that puts science within the reach of every person wanting to know and act rightly.
