% Having something bad happen to you

In Japanese, the form used to make passives out of transitive verbs is also used to make a passive out of intransitive verbs, the nuisance passive.

In English, you can make passives out of some intransitive verbs in some, but not all, cases, eg

	Elizabeth I slept in this bed.
	This bed was slept in by Elizabeth I.

	It looks like he slept in those clothes.
	His clothes look like they've been slept in

	Rats sleep in the daytime.
	* The daytime is slept in by rats.

	(Staff showing visitor around Princeton cafeteria)
	Einstein ate at this table.
	* This table was eaten at by Einstein.

	(On sewer tour)
	A: I can't believe workers ate in here.
	B: Really? The sewers were eaten in?
	A: That's what the guide said.

	Possible?

Anyway, the nuisance passive in Japanese is 

	I was died by my parents when I was a child.

In English, might be expressed, A happens "on X", or "X has" A happen.

	My parents died on me, when I was a child.
	I had my parents die, when I was a child.

The latter can be indistinguishable from a 'has' causative.

	I had my car broken into.
	I had/got my car fixed.

	I had my son take piano lessons.
	I had my son break into people's cars.

The Japanese causatives and passives can also take the same form with transitive and intransitive verbs.
