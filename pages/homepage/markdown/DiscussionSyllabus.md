| In a reading and discussion       |                                   |
| class, I would actually do a      |                                   |
| little writing for homework. I    |                                   |
| might even have the students in   |                                   |
| week 4, 9, 13 and 18 spend half   |                                   |
| of the lesson writing essays,     |                                   |
| effectively converting the        |                                   |
| midterm and final exams into an   |                                   |
| informal writing-                 |                                   |
| before-discussion experience. As  |                                   |
| a result, I would have 4 tests in |                                   |
| my assessment schedule (instead   |                                   |
| of the traditional 2). Each test  |                                   |
| would be worth 10 points for a    |                                   |
| total of 40 percent of the grade. |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| As well as having students write  |                                   |
| a little in class, I would assign |                                   |
| readings as homework each week,   |                                   |
| having them answer questions on   |                                   |
| an Internet page and leave notes  |                                   |
| on a class wiki (as at            |                                   |
| <http://momotaro.chinmin.edu.tw/k |                                   |
| wiki/NewsPaper/index.cgi)>.       |                                   |
| Each of these readings would be   |                                   |
| worth 2 points for a total of 20  |                                   |
| percent of the grade. The         |                                   |
| homework thus would have          |                                   |
| equivalent weight to a midterm or |                                   |
| final exam. Traditionally,        |                                   |
| homework contributes much less to |                                   |
| the grade.                        |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| The final 40 percent would be for |                                   |
| classwork discussion. This is the |                                   |
| most important part of the class. |                                   |
| The weekly class discussion       |                                   |
| provides the most                 |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| The ideal is to have content      |                                   |
| about which the students are      |                                   |
| excited and want to express       |                                   |
| themselves. This suggests giving  |                                   |
| some control over the topics of   |                                   |
| the class. The students like the  |                                   |
| security of a textbook, but it    |                                   |
| sets the syllabus for the whole   |                                   |
| of the semester, and it isn\'t    |                                   |
| very flexible.                    |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| UNFINISHED: The following is      |                                   |
| about a                           |                                   |
| [CompositionSyllabus](Composition |                                   |
| Syllabus.html)                    |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I rationalized this failure as    |                                   |
| due to the difference between the |                                   |
| view of writing as watercolor     |                                   |
| painting (Chinese painting) and   |                                   |
| the view of writing as oil        |                                   |
| painting (Western painting). My   |                                   |
| students saw their work as        |                                   |
| unretouchable and uneditable, as  |                                   |
| accomplished, as unanalyzable. It |                                   |
| was easier to write a new essay,  |                                   |
| than to rewrite an old essay. It  |                                   |
| was easier for them to write an   |                                   |
| essay, than to read each others\' |                                   |
| essays! This inversion of the     |                                   |
| usual situation where it is       |                                   |
| easier for you, the reader to     |                                   |
| read this, than it is for me, the |                                   |
| writer to write it, makes the     |                                   |
| process approach very hard to     |                                   |
