% AI not using sentence-level devices creating relevance to the text topic?

I don't get the feeling AI-generated texts are on top of the argument. They pop in at the right time and offer an appropriate comment and then go back to sleep.

At least they aren't explicitly signaling how the argument hangs together. They aren't producing incoherent text, but they aren't aware (convincing me they understand) that coherence is a significant feature of text.

What would convince me is evidence grammatical and lexical devices that give texts cohesion
([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(linguistics)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohesion_(linguistics)))
are handled well.

An example of cohesion failure was ChatGPT producing 'a verb', rather than 'the verb' describing 'lead' at
