| My main form of exercise is       |                                   |
| jogging. This is better than      |                                   |
| cycling, because cycling you can  |                                   |
| go too fast, so it is dangerous.  |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Jogging, I can run 6 kilometers   |                                   |
| in an hour. I used to be able to  |                                   |
| run 10 kilometers in an hour. I   |                                   |
| usually run 25 times round the    |                                   |
| school track on Saturday and      |                                   |
| Sunday. It\'s a short track.      |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I don\'t do any competitive       |                                   |
| running. I am not really          |                                   |
| interested in running with other  |                                   |
| people. The Loneliness of the     |                                   |
| Long Distance Runner, as the name |                                   |
| of an old movie had it.           |                                   |

| This is interesting, because I    |                                   |
| use a lot of competition in my    |                                   |
| classes. I also wasn\'t           |                                   |
| interested in running when I was  |                                   |
| at school, although I was         |                                   |
| interested in sailing with my     |                                   |
| dad.                              |                                   |

| Perhaps I\'m not the sort of      |                                   |
| person I find in my classes.      |                                   |

| How can we make language learning |                                   |
