## Source of questions

In Taiwan, NCKU has an [internal academic editing service][1]
staffed by foreign teachers associated with the university, 
[NDHU][3] also has one.

Researchers can choose from a list of available teacher/editors 
the one they wish to edit their manuscript. And the teacher/editors
have [descriptions of their requirements and their strengths][2] as 
editors.

Researchers pay the service which pays the editors. (In Korea, 
Yonsei U will pay for [editing by external commercial 
services][4] and it maintains a list of services with 
relationships with the school.)

Two of the items that I thought were good questions were 
*Proofreading Approach* and *Acceptable File Formats*.

I want to answer those questions myself.

## Proofreading Approach

  I find it difficult to describe what I'm doing when I am editing.

  It is hard to think about what one is doing when one is so 
  concentrated on the *text* itself and on how the *problems* it 
  presents can be solved that one loses consciousness of everything 
  else.

  The focus is so much on the product, it is difficult to say
  anything about the process.

  I know I am very critical top-down and bottom-up. Typically,
  I make changes in almost every line of a text. Reading like 
  a journal editor trying to follow the argument, I think:

	  "Is this what a native-speaking researcher
	  would say in this context?"

	  "This can't be the best way to say what I
	  think the writer is trying to say."
  
  Then I use my resources as an experienced editor to solve the 
  particular problem at hand.

  But I am also very critical of myself. Re-reading my changes
  later, I will often think, 'What was I thinking? It
  seemed like an improvement at the time,' and I will have to
  try again.

  Editing sentences containing technical *terminology*, or 
  the *terms of art* of the subject area of the paper, is 
  something that non-expert native speakers of English 
  cannot be relied on to do correctly.

  I once changed the phrase, 'a [feature] trending 
  south-southwest' in a geology paper, because I thought 
  'trend' is a noun, not a verb. The author had to correct me.

  In a materials science paper, the process by which a chemical was 
  prepared was detailed. Two chemical compounds were 
  combined 'under rapid stirring'? 'Under rapid stirring'? 
  I changed it to 'while being stirred rapidly.' I then 
  looked it up on the Internet,
  [under stirring][4]

  Google has made academic editing a lot easier!

  I sometimes use 
  [https://books.google.com/ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams)
  to see which of two wordings is more used. For example, 
  talking about the degree to which two competing alternatives 
  approach some ideal value, you can talk about their 
  'fitness.' But would you use the expressions, 'higher 
  fitness' or 'greater fitness'? Which do you think is more 
  used? Check it on
  [https://books.google.com/ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams)

  While I am critical, it is important not to correct what 
  is not wrong. In style cases for example. I think:

          "Even though a native speaker might not have used
          this turn of phrase here, it has an appeal about it,
          and should not be edited out."

          "Not a dry, academic document, this paper
          with some touches of liveliness here and there
          is to be appreciated."

## Acceptable File Formats

  First, let me say I will edit any file in any format I am 
  sent.

  That said, my order of preferences is:

  * [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text)
or [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files
  * [latex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) documents
  * [MS Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word) files
