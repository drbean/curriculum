## Proofreading Approach

*Question*: What is your approach to editing?[^source1]

*Answer*: That's a good question, but giving a good answer is difficult. Let me answer at length at [EditingApproach](EditingApproach.html)

[^source1]: Not actually questions I've been asked, but one asked of editors at NCCU

    In Taiwan, NCKU has an [internal academic editing service][1]
staffed by foreign teachers associated with the university, 
[NDHU][3] also has one.

    Researchers can choose from a list of available teacher/editors 
the one they wish to edit their manuscript. And the teacher/editors
have [descriptions of their requirements and their strengths][2] as 
editors.

    Researchers pay the service which pays the editors. (In Korea, 
Yonsei U will pay for [editing by external commercial 
services][4] and it maintains a list of services with 
relationships with the school.)

    Two of the items that I thought were good questions were 
*Proofreading Approach* and *Acceptable File Formats*.

    I wanted to answer those questions myself.


## Acceptable File Formats

*Question*: As what kind of file should I send my paper to you?[^source2]

[^source2]: As for the question, [Proofreading Approach], this is not one I have actually been asked. See the footnote to that question.

*Answer*: I will edit any file in any format I am sent.

  That said, I have an
[OrderOfPreferences](AcceptableFileFormats.html)

## Rewriting

*Question*: Do you understand my argument? I don't think I understand it myself.
Can you rewrite the paper for me?

*Answer*: No, I can't do that. See 
[ReWriting](ReWriting.html)

## Using First Language

*Question* Can you read Chinese, Japanese or Korean? 
Maybe, l need to use my native languagge to express my meanings sometimes.

*Answer*: Yes, we can do that. See 
[UsingFirstLanguage](UsingFirstLanguage.html)

## Discipline-specific experience

*Question* My major research is XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX and YYYYYYY YYYYYYYY.
It seems that you did not do the related article for English
editing. For example, aaaaaaaaaaa aaaa, bbbb bbbbbbbâ€¦

*Answer* I did edit an article on ZZZZZZZZ a long time ago, and recently I
have been editing a cccccccccccc article about the dddddddd ddddddd by
someone at UUU University.

But, no, I haven't ever edited a XXXXXXXXX XXXXXXXX paper.

But I would like to try. I think I would do a
