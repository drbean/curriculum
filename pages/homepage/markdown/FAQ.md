## Proofreading Approach

*Question*: What is your approach to editing?[^source1]

*Answer*: That's a good question, but giving a good answer is difficult. Let me answer at length at [EditingApproach](EditingApproach.html)

[^source1]: Not actually questions I've been asked, but one asked of editors at NCKU

    In Taiwan, NCKU has (had) an [internal academic editing service][1]
staffed by foreign teachers associated with the university, 
[NDHU][3] also has one.

    Researchers can choose from a list of available teacher/editors 
the one they wish to edit their manuscript. And the teacher/editors
have [descriptions of their requirements and their strengths][2] as 
editors.

    Researchers pay the service which pays the editors. (In Korea, 
Yonsei U will pay for [editing by external commercial 
services][4] and it maintains a list of services with 
relationships with the school.)

    I wanted to answer those questions myself.


## Acceptable File Formats

*Question*: As what kind of file should I send my paper to you?[^source2]

[^source2]: As for the question, [Proofreading Approach], this is not one I have actually been asked. See the footnote to that question.

  That said, I have an

## Rewriting

*Question*: Do you understand my argument? I don't think I understand it myself.
Can you rewrite the paper for me?

*Answer*: No, I can't do that. See 
[ReWriting](ReWriting.html)

## Using First Language

*Question* Can you read Chinese, Japanese or Korean? 
Maybe, l need to use my native languagge to express my meanings sometimes.

*Answer*: Yes, we can do that. See 
[UsingFirstLanguage](UsingFirstLanguage.html)

## Discipline-specific experience

*Question* My major research is in X and Y.
It seems that you did not do the related article for English
editing. For example, a, b â€¦

*Answer* I did edit an article on Z a long time ago, and recently I

someone at U University.

But, no, I haven't ever edited an X paper.

But I would like to try. I think I would do a

## Track Changes

*Question* Can you use Track Changes in MS Word so I can see what changes you make?

*Answer* Sorry, I can't usually do that. Let me explain at 
[TrackChanges](TrackChanges.html).

## Strengths and Weaknesses

*Questio* What are your strengths and weaknesses?

*Answer* My strengths are my English language skills, my attention to detail, my ability and desire to understand difficult material and my experience. See 
[GoodJob](GoodJob.html)

My weaknesses are that it may take me more than a week to finish a long paper and my wish that I did not have to deal with MS Word. See
[FileFormats](AcceptableFileFormats.html)
