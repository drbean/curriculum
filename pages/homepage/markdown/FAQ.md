NCKU has an [internal academic editing service][1]
staffed by foreign teachers associated with the university, 
[NDHU][3] also has one.

Researchers can choose from a list of available teacher/editors 
the one they wish to edit their manuscript. And the teacher/editors
have [descriptions of their requirements and their strengths][2] as 
editors.

Two of the items that I thought were good questions were 
*Proofreading Approach* and *Acceptable File Formats*.

I want to answer those questions myself.

Proofreading Approach
  ~ I find it difficult to describe what I'm doing when I am editing.

  It is hard to think about what one is doing when one is so 
  concentrated on the *text* itself and on how the *problems* it 
  presents can be solved that one loses consciousness of everything 
  else.

  The focus is so much on the product, it is difficult to say
  anything about the process.

  I know I am very critical top-down and bottom-up. Typically,
  I make changes in almost every line of a text. Reading like 
  a journal editor trying to follow the argument, I think:

	  "Is this what a native-speaking researcher
	  would say in this context?"

	  "This can't be the best way to say what I
	  think the writer is trying to say."
  
  Then I use my resources as an experienced editor to solve the 
  particular problem at hand.

  But I am also very critical of my own edits. A fresh 
  re-read will often evoke the response, 'What was I 
  thinking?'

  I often use 
  [https://books.google.com/ngrams](https://books.google.com/ngrams)
  to see which of two wordings is more used. For example, 
  'higher fitness' or 'greater fitness'. Which do you think 
  is more used?

  While I am critical, it is important not to overcorrect. In style
  cases for example. I think:

          "Even though a native speaker might not have used
          this turn of phrase here, it has an appeal about it,
          and should not be edited out."

          "Not a dry, academic document, this paper
          with some touches of liveliness here and there
          is to be appreciated."

Acceptable File Formats
  ~ First, let me say I will edit any file in any format I am 
    sent.

    That said, my order of preferences is:

    * [plain text](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plain_text)
or [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files
    * [latex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX) documents
    * [MS Word](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word) files
