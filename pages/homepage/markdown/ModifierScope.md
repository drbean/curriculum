% How far verb, noun modifiers reach.

In the Unix error message, `Bad command
or filename`, if the problem isn't due 
to a bad command, is it because of a 
filename or a bad filename?

Does the adjective, 'bad' apply to both 
nouns, 'command' and 'filename', or just 
the first one?

When context does not help, there is 
probably no way of deciding, except by 
asking.

There may be conditions which inhibit or 
encourage extension to following nouns.

For me, encountering an uncontexted `free
software and beer`, the adjective, 'free' does 
not apply to 'beer', even though free beer 
is a topic sometimes introduced in 
discussions of free software.

However if it comes in the context of a 
statement by a college hacking club,

	We believe in free software 
	and beer.

I would be more inclined to see it as 
possibly a reference to free beer,

On the other hand, an uncontexted `free
software and hardware` is refering to 
free hardware, I think, though free 
hardware is a topic not as often brought 
up as free beer and even in the context 
of free software not common, and vice 
versa, no?

Perhaps there is something more 
fundamentally different about these two 
cases. Software and beer are quite 
different things, but software and 
hardware, beyond the word form 
similarities, are both things required 
to use computers. The relationship 
between the two was put forward as a 
conceptualization to explain how 
computers work.

What about adverbs modifying verbs and 
in particular, 2 adverbs with 1 verb? 
I'm not sure why I think this is part of 
the same topic.

Because we have dueling scopes?

	I was trying to understand their 
	position.

	It took me a while. It took me 
	aback.

But not

	It took me a while and aback.

Instead

	It took me a while because it 
	took me aback.

This is probably because in the first 
sentence, 'it' refers to understanding 
the position. In the second, it refers 
to the position itself.

In the first, 'take' means take time. In 
the second, it means have an effect.

This is a well-discussed modifier scope 
conflict. In particular, SCOTUS's 
Justice Scalia has an example.
