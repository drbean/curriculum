% Agency as a framework for understanding AI is unhelpful.  
Associating apps with 
Not making the distinction 
Rather than attacking agency head on, I'm going to attack 
the problem of goals. The argument is going to be one from 
analogy. 

It's like explaining the world as being the result of God's 
handiwork. That explanation shuts down understanding rather 
than advances it. Goals are important, and then end-means 
analysis becomes important in explaining how to reach them, 
but agency doesn't help devise ways to get an AI app to reach
the goals we set for it.

Consider the accepted idea that evolutionary change is not 
goal oriented.  Individuals are goal-oriented. Preservation 
of species by the procreation of individuals of the species 
to which they belong appears goal-oriented but the 
proliferation of certain individuals and disappearance of 
others by selection is not an end, either success or 
failure, to which evolutionary change is working.

Nevertheless, there persists the mistaken idea that 
evolution is a process of improvement guided by trial and 
error. It is actually the temporal interaction of two 
independent processes, random genetic change and 
the chopping block of natural selection (ie, the fate of 
species).

I think the problem biology has defining 
['species'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/species) is 
connected to this confusion. Are species real or do they 
exist in name only?

Deciding AI apps have agency is the same kind of mistake.

Incidentally, I thought the Shakespeare family line had 
disappeared, but [famous Shakespeares on 
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_(surname)) 
shows it alive and well.

The disappearance of family lines does not indicate those 
lines were failures. It only indicates that there was a last 
surviving male member. By definition, this member did not have 
any male children, but a female member might have continued 
a line of matrilineal descent.

I want to argue that the attention a proliferating species 
gets at the expense of one that disappears, and the mistaken 
idea that evolutionary change has goals, together lead to the 
idea that the proliferating species has the goal of 
self-preservation, that it has it to a greater degree than the 
disappearing species and that it is more successful at achieving 
that goal.

I think that's a mistake. Self-replication by instances is 
just something the species does. Making lots of copies of 
itself leads to self-preservation of the species/population, 
but self-preservation is not a goal of the species. It is 
just a consequence of the replication and big population. 
Inferring goals requires more than a cause and effect 
relationship, as the theory of evolution, which is not 
goal-oriented, shows. There needs to be a context of 
interaction over time.

Leaving aside the question whether species have the goal of 
self-replication through (a)sexual reproduction of their 
instances, what about individuals?  People have goals. They 
have ideas about how to reach them and engage in trial and 
error to reach them.  But what about the sexual activity 
responsible for preservation of the species? People have a 
drive to engage in sex, but specifically for men do they 
have goals they seek to attain through sexual intercourse? 
Does a means-end analysis help us understand their sexual 
activity?

Listing possible goals:

* intimacy
* penetration
* orgasm and ejaculation
* achieving/avoiding impregnation of partners and
    having children

I think these are better considered parts of or stages in sex. Rather 
than sex being a means by which these goals are achieved.

For men, orgasms aren't considered the ends of sex and sex 
isn't considered the means by which orgasms are achieved. 
Men are not considering the purpose of sex when they engage 
in it. There is no ends-means distinction.

The same applies to eating. It's not really for eaters a 
means-ends activity, though if you're hungry, it may be. You 
know that eating something is a way to stop feeling hungry.

Unless you're Socrates, who said he ate to live but that 
others lived to eat.

Many men father children. 60% of men in the US are fathers 
and 75% of men aged 40-49 are fathers. But most men I don't 
think engage in sex as a means to an end, for the purpose of 
having children.

They recognize it as a consequence, foreseen or unforeseen, of 
sex, but not the reason they engage in it. I think they are 
surprised rather than relieved when their partners tell them 
they are pregnant. They may want children, but 
it is not the reason they are sexually active.

Although the reason some men apparently do have sex is because they want 
children. [Ferdinand_de_Lesseps](Ferdinand_de_Lesseps.html) 
for example had 12 children in the 15 years between the ages 
of 65 and 80, before dying 9 years later at the age of 89.

This 'blind spot' men have to becoming fathers is no problem 
for homo sapiens because their biology does the thinking 
required for them.

The [category 
mistake](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/category-mistakes/) 
of ascribing purpose to evolution and perhaps goals to 
species is mirrored in the mistake of ascribing
goals and agency to AI apps.
