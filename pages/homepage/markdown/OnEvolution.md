% Agency and goals as a framework for understanding evolution are unhelpful.  

It wasn't my intention to take on the issue of evolution. I 
decided to tackle it in the discussion of AI in 
[AgainstAgency](AgainstAgency.html), thinking an analogy in 
biology would explain why conferring agency on AI is a 
mistake, like it is in evolution.

I think it is better not to consider evolution as a 'thing'
but rather as a theory, or at least a way of looking at 
change that make sense of a number of things that are 
counterintuitive.

Like in the Old Man River song, the river is indifferent to the 
troubles the people suffer, and evolution as a process is 
unconnected to any of the concerns people face. It just 
keeps rolling along in a process unconnected to 
any that people understand.

Change happens. People are dying every day. They're dying 
like flies, considered at the time scales at which the human genome
changes and evolution works, quite longer than the months 
required for fly genome change.

Death of individuals in the short term of a natural life
is a regular thing, so it's understandable. Other non-biological 
things also wear out.

But homo sapiens could also die out in the long term, because the 
resources people need to sustain life are not guaranteed to 
exist in the long term even if their supply seems regular 
in the short term.

This is imaginable, but homo sapiens seems determined not to 
die out in the short term. As individuals die, their 
grandchildren or great grandchildren are born, replacing 
them in greater or lesser numbers. Reproduction leads to 
preservation. It seems like a goal of homo sapiens is not to 
die out in the long term, but to live potentially forever
through the power of sexual reproduction. 

It is a truth widely, if not universally, accepted that 
evolution has no goals. Evolutionary change just keeps 
rolling along. Which seems to be incompatible with the goal 
of homo sapiens not to die out.

Saying change in biology has goals is like explaining the 
world as being the result of God's handiwork. That 
explanation shuts down understanding rather than advances 
it. Goals are important elsewhere, and end-means analysis is 
important in explaining how to reach them, but goals, and by 
implication, agency, doesn't help understand biological 
change or even devise ways to prevent species extinction.

Consider the accepted idea that evolutionary change is not 
goal oriented.  Individuals are goal-oriented. Preservation 
of species by the procreation of individuals of the species 
to which they belong appears goal-oriented but the 
proliferation of certain individuals and disappearance of 
others by selection is not an end, either success or 
failure, to which evolutionary change is working.

Life needs the constant supply of resources, which is not 
guaranteed to exist. And when it ends, life ends, too.
Certain groups, if not all groups, die out.

This is not something that anything or any group is working 
toward, unless they don't like the group. For its part, 
evolutionary change just keeps rolling along.

### No trial and error, no feedback, no agency

Nevertheless, there persists the mistaken idea that 
evolution is a process of improvement guided by trial and 
error.

The idea is that wrong paths can be backed out of, or at 
least deprecated, and the right paths (meaning, the existing 
ones) taken instead, following
[Aristotle](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/)
, who 'argues that 
there is no other way to explain natural generation than by 
reference to what lies at the end of the process.'

Actually the temporal interaction of two independent 
processes, random genetic change and the chopping block of 
natural selection (ie, the fate of species) over immense (or 
not) time scales is what accounts for evolution.

Given that we can't beg the question by ascribing the cause 
to the effect, how do we find a cause, an immediate, 
proximate cause, for the observation that certain groups 
prevail and other groups are no longer seen?

A
[proximal cause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_and_ultimate_causation)
for the contrast in the numbers in the corresponding groups 
is needed.

That cause can only be that in the groups that prevail, in 
each generation a sufficient number of individuals are born, 
live to maturity and produce offspring in enough numbers for 
this process to be replicated in the next generation. Thus 
we need a [self-replicating 
process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-replication), 
like mathematical induction or perhaps a quine or runaway 
one, like in computer programming. In the groups that die 
out, this process is interrupted.

The ultimate causes will be those explored by evolutionary 
biologists. But rather than a search for an ultimate cause, 
we want to search for a beneficiary, the agent or actor with objectives whose interests are or are not served by having a group die out, or alternatively by having it continue.

The theory of evolution is saying we don't need 
agency to explain whether groups prevail or die out.

I don't think there is such an agent. There is no purpose 
behind the self-replication of groups as they persist, 
proliferate or contract. The process just is. No why, just a 
thing.

The basis for the is not because of the first's greater desire or greater ability to read the climate of the times.

The role of population variability in natural selection is?

Cause types: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proximate_and_ultimate_causation
https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/#FourCauses

I think the problem biology has defining 
['species'](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/species) is 
connected to this confusion. Are species real or do they 
exist in name only as imagined concepts like imaginary 
numbers, or even just the abstract concept of number, perhaps?

Deciding AI apps have agency is the same kind of mistake.

Incidentally, I thought the Shakespeare family line had 
disappeared, but [famous Shakespeares on 
Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shakespeare_(surname)) 
shows it alive and well.

The disappearance of family lines does not indicate those 
lines were failures. It only indicates that there was a last 
surviving male member. By definition, this member did not have 
any male children, but a female member might have continued 
a line of matrilineal descent.

I want to argue that the attention a proliferating species 
gets at the expense of one that disappears, and the mistaken 
idea that evolutionary change has goals, together lead to the 
idea that the proliferating species has the goal of 
self-preservation, that it has it to a greater degree than the 
disappearing species and that it is more successful at achieving 
that goal.

I think that's a mistake. Self-replication by instances is 
just something the species does. Making lots of copies of 
itself leads to self-preservation of the species/population, 
but self-preservation is not a goal of the species. It is 
just a consequence of the replication and big population.
Inferring goals requires more than a cause and effect 
relationship, as the theory of evolution, which is not 
goal-oriented, shows. There needs to be a context of 
interaction over time.

Leaving aside the question whether species have the goal of 
self-replication through (a)sexual reproduction of their 
instances, what about individuals?  People have goals. They 
have ideas about how to reach them and engage in trial and 
error to reach them.  But what about the sexual activity 
responsible for preservation of the species? People have a 
drive to engage in sex, but specifically for men do they 
have goals they seek to attain through sexual intercourse? 
Does a means-end analysis help us understand their sexual 
activity?

Listing possible goals:

* intimacy
* penetration
* orgasm and ejaculation
* achieving/avoiding impregnation of partners and
    having children

Certainly, at each of these points, or stages in sex, the 
next stage becomes an objective, or a goal. But, I think these events 
in sex are better considered parts of or stages in sex, 
rather than the goals of sex, and sex being a means by which 
the goals are achieved.

For men, orgasms aren't considered the ends of sex and sex 
isn't considered the means by which orgasms are achieved. 
Men are not considering the purpose of sex when they engage 
in it. There is no ends-means distinction.

Many men father children. 60% of men in the US are fathers 
and 75% of men aged 40-49 are fathers. But most men I don't 
think engage in sex as a means to an end, for the purpose of 
having children.

They recognize it as a consequence, foreseen or unforeseen, of 
sex, but not the reason they engage in it. I think they are 
surprised rather than relieved when their partners tell them 
they are pregnant. They may want children, but 
it is not the reason they are sexually active.

Although the reason some men apparently do have sex is because they want 
children. [Ferdinand_de_Lesseps](Ferdinand_de_Lesseps.html) 
for example had 12 children in the 15 years between the ages 
of 65 and 80, before dying 9 years later at the age of 89.

This 'blind spot' men have to becoming fathers is no problem 
for homo sapiens because their biology does the thinking 
required for them.

The same applies to eating. It's not really for eaters a 
means-ends activity, though if you're hungry, it may be. You 
know that eating something is a way to stop feeling hungry.

Unless you're Socrates, who said he ate to live but that 
others lived to eat.

Read
[FoodClothingShelter](FoodClothingShelter.html).

What does this inconsistency between the crucial role of 
eating and sex in realizing the goal of preservation of the 
species, and the reason men engage in sex and people eat not usually being 
for this end at all say about the status of the goal? 

Certainly, if they have ends in mind for these activities at 
all, it is for their own benefit or that of the groups to 
which they belong, not to any abstract desire to ensure homo 
sapiens, the human race doesn't die out.

The [category 
mistake](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/category-mistakes/) 
of ascribing purpose to evolution and perhaps goals to 
species is mirrored in the mistake of ascribing
goals and agency to AI apps.
