| I did a lot of hitchhiking when I |                                   |
| was younger. I have hitchhiked a  |                                   |
| lot of the way round Australia    |                                   |
| from the west clockwise, to the   |                                   |
| north. The other quarter I        |                                   |
| haven\'t hitchhiked is the most   |                                   |
| difficult.                        |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Recently in Taiwan, I have been   |                                   |
| hitchhiking. It is a good way to  |                                   |
| meet people and talk, I think.    |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I even had my picture in the      |                                   |
| newspaper in 2005.                |                                   |
