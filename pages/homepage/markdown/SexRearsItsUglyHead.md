the survival of the individual is ensured.

The survival of the human race is not insured, unless the need/want/desire of men for ejaculation (or is it, penetration) in a woman is satisfied.

Speaking for all men, I say we are confused about the relation of intercourse with intimacy.

We understand sex is impossible without physical entanglement.

We don't understand the emotional entanglement, attachment, bonds that result from intercourse, and which I believe (but cannot prove) are baked in to intercourse. That is, the chemistry is more like that of tobacco addiction than it is like that of the love of money.

Seeing it as an analogue to the physical tie that locks together copulating dogs helps me understand it.

I told my significant other 40 years ago that I could accept if she wanted that we stop having sex, but I asked her not to stop allowing physical intimacy.

What am I saying? That I don't know what I'm talking about!
