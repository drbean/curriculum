[school reform](https://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2023/11/18/how-my-thinking-about-school-reform-has-changed-over-the-decades/)

used a past-participle noun modifier, 'returned' rather than 'returning.'

[A] belief in the power of schools .. took me to Washington .. to train returned Peace Corps volunteers ..

In
[the previous article](https://larrycuban.wordpress.com/2023/11/16/program-success-or-failure-not-a-judgement-for-the-faint-of-heart/)

he used 'returning'

The Cardozo Project in Urban Teaching, as it was then called, prepared returning Peace Corps Volunteers to teach in urban schools.

In 'interesting/interested', the difference distinguishes between the source and target of the modifier, expanding as active/passive phrases.

But in other cases, like 'fallen soldiers' and 'misbehaved students', it doesn't.

Did he not use 'prepared returned' in the previous article because it was 2 past participles in succession?
