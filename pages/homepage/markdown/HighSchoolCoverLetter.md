| Chinmin Institute of Technology   |                                   |
| is closing down its AFL           |                                   |
| Department, and I am looking for  |                                   |
| another job. As a result of my    |                                   |
| experiences here, I would be      |                                   |
| interested in teaching at a high  |                                   |
| school. I wonder if you are       |                                   |
| interested in having me teach     |                                   |
| English full time at your school. |                                   |
| I think I would be an asset to    |                                   |
| your English department.          |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| For the eight years I have been   |                                   |
| in Taiwan at Chinmin, I have been |                                   |
| working with lower-level,         |                                   |
| unmotivated students. Although it |                                   |
| has been a challenge teaching     |                                   |
| these students, it has been       |                                   |
| rewarding, and even if I can\'t   |                                   |
| say I achieved a lot of the       |                                   |
| things I set out to do with them, |                                   |
| I believe I have developed a      |                                   |
| teaching style with large classes |                                   |
| that is innovative and effective. |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| One of the rewards for me has     |                                   |
| been the realization that I did   |                                   |
| an excellent job creating         |                                   |
| favorable attitudes to English    |                                   |
| and significantly increasing      |                                   |
| achievement. I seem to have       |                                   |
| gained my students\' respect,     |                                   |
| perhaps because my teaching       |                                   |
| style, although communicative, is |                                   |
| supportive of all my students,    |                                   |
| both good and bad.                |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| But the problems of these         |                                   |
| students were unsolvable by me.   |                                   |
| This has prompted me to think     |                                   |
| that perhaps if I intervened at   |                                   |
| an earlier stage, in high school  |                                   |
| for example, I could do a better  |                                   |
| job solving the problems, which I |                                   |
| believe they share with all       |                                   |
| students who learn English in the |                                   |
| formal education system in        |                                   |

| These problems are:               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |

| With this next step in my career, |                                   |
| I look forward to becoming even a |                                   |
| better teacher by the continued   |                                   |
| development of my methods with    |                                   |
| large classes and under difficult |                                   |
| conditions. I am confident the    |                                   |
| future is bright. I hope that     |                                   |
| your school also has such views   |                                   |
| and is a forward-looking place to |                                   |
