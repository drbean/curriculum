| Here is my exam procedure.        |                                   |
| Students have been working        |                                   |
| together with a partner for the   |                                   |
| previous 3-4 weeks.               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| There is a list of the order in   |                                   |
| which pairs will do the           |                                   |
| dictation. WHEN it is their turn, |                                   |
| I call each pair over to sit at   |                                   |
| two tables turned to face each    |                                   |
| other. In between the 2 tables,   |                                   |
| there is a screen which prevents  |                                   |
| the students seeing the other\'s  |                                   |
| card.                             |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I try to put student A            |                                   |
| consistently on either the        |                                   |
| left-hand side, or the right-hand |                                   |
| side, so that I can follow the    |                                   |
| dialogue. I sit at another table, |                                   |
| facing the 2 students. My table   |                                   |
| makes a triangle with their       |                                   |
| tables. I have a copy of the      |                                   |
| dialogues they are doing to help  |                                   |
| me follow along. Typically, the   |                                   |
| dialog is in 3 separate sections  |                                   |
| and there are 2 parallel texts    |                                   |
| for each section. The students    |                                   |
| have practiced the same or        |                                   |
| similar texts in the previous     |                                   |
| weeks.                            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| 1\. I give each student their     |                                   |
| card, and get them to sign it.    |                                   |
| When                              |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| ``` {.formatter_pre}              |                                   |
| they have signed it, they can tur |                                   |
| n it over to look at the          |                                   |
| dialogue.                         |                                   |
| ```                               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| 2\. I say, \'No Chinese.\' I      |                                   |
| say, \'You\'re A. You\'re B.      |                                   |
| Are you                           |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| ``` {.formatter_pre}              |                                   |
| ready? Go.'                       |                                   |
| ```                               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| 3\. I then start the stop watch.  |                                   |
| They have 3 minutes.              |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| 4\. I don\'t think I have to      |                                   |
| tell them what they have to do,   |                                   |
| but if                            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| ``` {.formatter_pre}              |                                   |
| they have absolutely no understan |                                   |
| ding, I say to A (or B),          |                                   |
| 'Read this line,' and I point to  |                                   |
| the line in the dialogue that     |                                   |
| they have reached. If they still  |                                   |
| don't read, I spell the           |                                   |
| individual letters of the words f |                                   |
| or the student, and have them     |                                   |
| repeat the letters.               |                                   |
| ```                               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| 5\. If they use Chinese, I look   |                                   |
| sternly at them, and repeat,      |                                   |
| \'No                              |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| ``` {.formatter_pre}              |                                   |
| Chinese,' and I keep a tally of t |                                   |
| he number of times they use       |                                   |
| Chinese on the schedule, next to  |                                   |
| their names. In particular, I     |                                   |
| don't allow them to discuss probl |                                   |
| ems they have doing the           |                                   |
| activity and to ask each other qu |                                   |
| estions about what they are       |                                   |
| supposed to do in Chinese. One of |                                   |
|  my aims is to get the            |                                   |
| students to practice clarificatio |                                   |
| n requests, and comprehension     |                                   |
| checks in English. In other words |                                   |
| , I want them to learn how to     |                                   |
| repair misunderstandings, by expe |                                   |
| riencing those                    |                                   |
| misunderstandings. If they do thi |                                   |
| s in Chinese, this is a           |                                   |
| significant degradation of the va |                                   |
| lue of the activity, I think.     |                                   |
| ```                               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| 6\. Looking at their partner\'s   |                                   |
| card or showing their card, or    |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| ``` {.formatter_pre}              |                                   |
| pointing at it, or open book is n |                                   |
| ot okay.                          |                                   |
| ```                               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| 7\. Calling the apostrophe,       |                                   |
| \'ipiei,\' or \'dotien,\' is      |                                   |
| not okay.                         |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| ``` {.formatter_pre}              |                                   |
| That's Chinese. Calling it a comm |                                   |
| a is okay.                        |                                   |
| ```                               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| 8\. Sometimes, students will not  |                                   |
| read the dialogue to each         |                                   |
| other,                            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| ``` {.formatter_pre}              |                                   |
| but will just try to fill in the  |                                   |
| missing letters. I want the       |                                   |
| exam to be a listening and speaki |                                   |
| ng exam, so this is not okay.     |                                   |
| I say to the student, whose turn  |                                   |
| it is, 'Read the line,' and       |                                   |
| point to the line they have reach |                                   |
| ed. Of course, it is okay to      |                                   |
