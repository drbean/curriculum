% 'Let' as a causative mood

drbean

:	I was looking for something I read by Anna Wierzbicka about 'let' as the preeminent English causative. It could be this, English causative constructions in an ethnosyntactic perspective: Focusing on LET. In: Nick Enfield (ed.), Ethnosyntax. Oxford: Oxford University Press. 162-203

	Anyway, she talked about the contradictions of a society based on liberalism in which people are free but which supports a very ordered way of life intricately set up that requires people getting other people to do things.


	She says 'let' plays a role in getting people to do things (did she also talk about whimperatives? I think she uses the example of the prof getting staff in the department office to do things. She can't just order them around)


	She links it with the change of meaning of 'let' (that is cognate with German 'lassen', I remember reading), from 'Let there be light, and there was light' and 'Let us pray' (ie, I say it, and it is so), to a suggestion and request for comment, eg 'Let's read Luke chapter 1, verse 1.'

	By fiat?

twb

twb

:	doesn't have a hortative case?

	We have other imperatives

	"take six eggs"

drbean

:	The same expression can be used to mean, The teacher sent the children home early, or, the teacher let the children go home early, depending on context.

twb

:	"sit down"

	"shut up"

	"let's" is hortative because it's only a suggestion, not an order

twb

:	"Shall we eat this human feet-first or head-first?"  "Let's eat him feet-first, so he can watch."

	personally I find them rather stringy

	Phrase of the day: lamps and lights

	Hrm apparently I'm confused

	the eyes and some other organ, is what I was thinking

	"lights" = lungs

drbean

:	without let or hindrance: Her Britannic Majesty's Secretary of State Requests and requires in the Name of Her Majesty all those whom it may concern to allow the bearer to pass freely without let or hindrance,

	That 'let' is not a hortative let.

	Interesting: a serve in tennis which hits the net and then falls in is called a "let."

	The Candian passport message is in French and English, but the French version doesn't translate the 'let', apparently. Le ministre des Affaires étrangères du Canada, au nom de Sa Majesté la Reine, prie les autorités intéressées de bien vouloir accorder libre passage au titulaire de ce passeport, de même que l'aide et la protection dont il aurait besoin.

	But it's in the English version, according to https://forum.wordreference.com/threads/let-or-hindrance.1039674/

:	According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_passport#Passport_message

:	'let' in computer science/math is the 'let' of 'let there be light', no? https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Let_expression

	'let' in 'Letting property' is in between 'let there be light' and the hortative 'let'? 'They let me use their house. For a price.' It's a causative 'let', I think.

twb

:	"let us" is hortative

	"let there be" is not

drbean

:	The wiktionary entry on 'let', https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/let, says 'Let me go to the store' could be addressed to someone preventing me going to the store, or it could be "a first-person singular imperative of “go” (not implying any such preventer)."

drbean

:	A self-directed imperative? Do they exist?

	'Down, dog. Down'

twb

:	They might not get that reference

drbean

:	From wiktionary: Let me just give you the phone number.

	It was suggested that is an ordinary imperative, not a first-person singular imperative.

	Wiktionary also mentions 'let' as an obsolete causative in the phrase 'let me know.'

	Can you let me know what time you'll be arriving?
