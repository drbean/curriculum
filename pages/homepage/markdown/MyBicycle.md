| I rode a racing bike in           |                                   |
| Australia, although I never did   |                                   |
| any racing. I did ride across     |                                   |
| Australia after dropping out of   |                                   |
| graduate school.                  |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| In Asia, I have only ridden old   |                                   |
| bikes. In Japan, I rode the       |                                   |
| bicycle of the boarding house,    |                                   |
| monopolizing it.                  |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| In Korea, I did not ride a bike.  |                                   |
| It was too dangerous.             |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| In Taiwan, I\'m riding a bicycle  |                                   |
| that was given to us by someone   |                                   |
| leaving the country. It is an old |                                   |
| bicycle, and the seat is too low. |                                   |
| But I like it.                    |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I ride it to the local store and  |                                   |
| to Toufen to go shopping mostly.  |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I did ride it from Taichung to    |                                   |
| Toufen, when I moved here in      |                                   |
| August, 2004. It took 6-8 hours.  |                                   |
| I had to take a rest on the way   |                                   |
| in Houlong, because I was getting |                                   |
| too sunburned.                    |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I rode to Hsinchu from Toufen     |                                   |
| once in 2005. The wind was        |                                   |
| against me on the way and it was  |                                   |
| strong, so it took a few hours.   |                                   |
| On the way back, it took only 40  |                                   |
| minutes. I flew.                  |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I used to be able to do 20-25     |                                   |
| kilometers an hour in Australia.  |                                   |
