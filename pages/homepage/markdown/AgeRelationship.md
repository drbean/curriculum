### Script

Hi. My name is Greg. I traveled with Mr Sato in western Japan last year. We talked about our ages. How old are you? How old am I?

#### Your task

I want you to tell me how old I am.

I'm older than you. You're not as old as me.
You're younger than me. I'm not as young as you.

But I want you to tell me how old I am.

I will help you guess, but first, I want you to tell me the answer to a math problem.

#### Math

I want you to write down the answer using '+', '-', 'x' or '/'.

Let's review '+', '-', 'x' and '/'.

Plus:

| 1 + 1 = 2
| 2 + 2 = 4
| 4 + 4 = 8
| 8 + 8 = 16

Say, '8 + 8 = 16'

Minus:

| 16 - 8 = 8
| 8 - 4 = 4
| 4 - 2 = 2
| 2 - 1 = 1

Say, '2 - 1 = 1'

Times:

| 2 x 1 = 2
| 2 x 2 = 4
| 2 x 4 = 8
| 2 x 8 = 16

Say, '2 x 8 = 16'

Divided by:

| 16 / 2 = 8
| 8 / 2 = 4
| 4 / 2 = 2
| 2 / 2 = 1

Say, '2 / 2 = 1'

#### Ages

OK. So, back to ages.

I guess you're 15. Perhaps you're not 15.

Perhaps you're younger than 15. 
Perhaps you're older than 15. 

Perhaps you were 15 last year, and you're older than that now.

I'm older than I was last year.
We're all older than we were last year.

But let's suppose you're 15. You're 15.

How old am I?

I'M FIVE TIMES YOUR AGE.

I want you to write an expression using the numbers, 5 and 15 and one of the signs, '+', '-', 'x' or '/'.

Get a pen and a piece of paper. Write down 2 numbers and one sign to show my age.

Did you write down 2 numbers and one of '+', '-', 'x' or '/'?
Which of the 4 signs did you use?

#### Explication

15 + 5 = 20. I can't be 20 years old. It's not 15 + 5.

15 - 5 = 10. I can't be 10 years old. It's not 15 - 5.

15 / 5 = 3. I can't be 3 years old. It's not 15 / 5.

It can only be the last one, 5 x 15, 15 X 5.

#### Answer

OK. So you wrote down the expression. What is the answer?
How old am I?

60, 75 or 90?

#### Extension

Are you older or younger than the person sitting next to you?

How many more months are you older or younger than the person sitting next to you?
