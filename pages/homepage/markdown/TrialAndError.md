How does trial and error align with Lewin's Action Research? Especially, seeing one of his principles was, 'There's nothing as practical as a good theory'. What is trial and error anyway? It seems like it can be used with negative connotations, 'Enough with the trial and error, already, It's not leading to a good result. Try a principled approach, like Response Surface Methodology'
