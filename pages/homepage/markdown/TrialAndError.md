% If at first you don't succeed, ..

How does trial and error align with Lewin's Action Research? Especially, seeing one of his principles was, 'There's nothing as practical as a good theory'.

What is trial and error anyway?

It seems like it can be used with negative connotations,

    They struggled with high costs due to the failure of trial and error to improve the rate.

    Enough with the trial and error, already, It's not leading to a good result. Try a principled approach, like Response Surface Methodology

    A: After a lot of trial and error, we gave up. It probably wasn't going to work, anyway.
    B: Sour grapes!

Thinks: Trial and error's the repeated doing of something despite not being successful, in search of success.

It's bottom-up rather than top-down.

Which doesn't align with, 'There's nothing as practical as a good theory.'

Nonetheless. it's a *Good Thing*.
