% Understanding stress

CUSP stands for Control, Uncertainty, Support and Pressure, a recipe for stress. The framework of some Scottish psychologists, it helps understand its causes. Lack of Control is whatever you do not working. Uncertainty is not knowing how things are going to work out from this point on. Lack of Support is when you don't have anyone to turn to and the people around you aren't helping. Pressure is the demands made of you by others or yourself.
