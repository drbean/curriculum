% The Secret Life of 'body', or the Use of 'From Head to Toe' as a euphemism

Only on hearing a Buddhist nun saying she was covered in sweat "all over my body" did I realize that 'body' has a secret life as a sexy word.

(Perhaps less tendentiously, I should say the body is sexy, not the word, 'body'.)

Anyway, since, I have been on the lookout for the use of the phrase, 'from head to toe' as a euphemism for 'all over the body.'

He says: 

	My wife has autoimmune disease. So because of that, I fear whenever I leave the house. How do I cope? Well, of course, you know, we wear our masks. Soon as I get home, I’m strippin’. Jumpin in the shower, clean myself from head to toe.

I think this could be called a way of talking about his body that is not provocative., ie a euphemism.
