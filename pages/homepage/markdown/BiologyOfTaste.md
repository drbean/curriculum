What do the attractions of tobacco say about the physiological mechanisms by which taste governs individual nutrition decisions that are biologically sound?

Except for sugar? Or especially for sugar?

And does this suggest there are ways to combat tobacco addiction, other than adding horrible tastes to cigarettes, as that doesn't work for alcohol.

Tobacco addiction goes beyond those physiological mechanisms of taste however by inducing a new substance need paralleling the need for food. This new substance need governed by the taste/smell of tobacco is biologically unsound. But can we still learn something about the role of good/bad tastes in making biologically-sound eating decisions?

What about raw meat? Eating it is, let's say, biologically-sound, because eating cooked meat is, it being nutritional. The Japanese eat raw fish, but is there any group where raw meat eating is a practice? (Apparently Inuit do) It doesn't taste good, but cooked meat does.

I want to find points in the evolution of Homo sapiens where cooking with fire and meat eating became common practices. If I can show some relationship, perhaps I can establish meat-eating became a practice after it started tasting good, because it was cooked.

Or perhaps, meat tastes evolved.

This runs up against food aversions which result in eating decisions with no nutritional benefit. And the eating of fermented foods despite "challenging" tastes.

For "biologically-sound/unsound" read "beneficial/unbeneficial"
And for "biologically-sound", or "beneficial", read "nutritious and with reduced risk of harm to health".

With this definition, eating of raw animal products (including milk and eggs?) is not biologically-sound, because of the risk of parasites. The unappealing taste of raw meat (and to a lesser extent of raw fish, but not animal milk?), and the "off" tastes of some non-fresh, non-cooked things which look they might still be swallowable, is a word to the wise, "Don't eat it!"

Nice tastes play a role in preservation of the species and are not just a nice-to-have.
Tobacco is just a bug in the physiology of taste (or smell).
