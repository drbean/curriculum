% I do a Good Job

I am a perfectionist, at the same time as I'm aware I'm not perfect.
Getting the English in a paper just right is what is important to me and what makes me feel good.

Actually, I'm quite modest, but I do a good job, because of:

1. my English language skills. See my old GRE scores [^source 3], in the top one (1) percent in Verbal Reasoning skills, top seven (7) percent in Quantitative Reasoning skills and top ten (10) percent in Analytical Reasoning skills.

2. The care with which I express myself. The details and the words used are important. It is important to me that I get all aspects of the paper right and the word I choose is the right word in the right place. To do that, I will use Google to check terminology and will even check the references cited.

3. My ability and desire to understand difficult material. I cannot be expert in all areas of the papers which I edit. Reading them is an education to me for which I thank the authors. But I need to think hard reading them, because they are not written as introductory-level texts. This work, however, is essential because it is impossible to judge correctness at a deep level without understanding what an author's intentions are in each sentence of a text. I am determined to achieve this understanding by considering all possibilities the sentence opens up, its context in the text, and requirements the discipline imposes.

4. My experience. I started working as an editor of at the Korea Times in 1986 and was there for 10 years.
