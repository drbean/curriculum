% A more design-conscious version of my site

On reading
[this post](https://abhinavsarkar.net/posts/static-site-generator-using-shake/)
about a
[Static Site Generator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_site_generator)
built on the #haskell #shake build system, I am tempted by the comparison of my drab home page and
Abhinav Sarkar's attractive site
to play around with
[the code](https://abhinavsarkar.net/code/shake-blog.html)
there.

I shouldn't be doing this. I should be trying to generate site traffic. If no-one is visiting my site, it doesn't matter what it looks like.
