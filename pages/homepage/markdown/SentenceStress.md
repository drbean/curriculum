% Speech aspires to poetry, poetry aspires to song

Here's a good explanation of why speech aspires to poetry, poetry aspires to 
song.

It says,

	"Sentence stress is the music of spoken English. ..  The time between 
	each stressed word is the same.  We maintain a constant beat on the 
	stressed words.  ... We change the speed of the small structure words 
	so that the rhythm of the key content words stays the same."

That's not how it's done in Japanese and Chinese. Japanese sounds like someone speaking through a typewriter. Chinese sounds like a typewriter that can't stay on key.
