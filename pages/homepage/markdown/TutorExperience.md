| I\'ve had my first real           |                                   |
| experience of tutoring here. My   |                                   |
| previous encounters with the      |                                   |
| students have mostly been the     |                                   |
| result of me approaching them,    |                                   |
| rather than them approaching me.  |                                   |
| It WAS gratifying, reassuring and |                                   |
| confidence-building to meet some  |                                   |
| graduates of my old school, who   |                                   |
| have become students here.        |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| But April, an Environmental       |                                   |
| Engineering 4th-year              |                                   |
| undergraduate (AKA senior) has    |                                   |
| been forward in exploiting my     |                                   |
| availabilty as a tutor in the     |                                   |
| Self-Access English Learning      |                                   |
| Room.                             |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| She wants to do a master\'s at    |                                   |
| National Taiwan University and we |                                   |
| are going through old English     |                                   |
| entrance exams at NTU.            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Almost immediately we hit on a    |                                   |
| good method. She does the         |                                   |
| questions at home beforehand.     |                                   |
| Then she reads the question to me |                                   |
| and either she or I answer it.    |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| This challenges me too, so is     |                                   |
| more interesting than my just     |                                   |
| reading the question and giving   |                                   |
| her my answer.                    |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Her reading comprehension and     |                                   |
| vocabulary are excellent, and     |                                   |
| generally her pronunciation is    |                                   |
| good. But she has the common      |                                   |
| problem here of confusing /n/ and |                                   |
| /m/ and her diphthongs are not    |                                   |
| distinguisable from short vowels. |                                   |
| For example, she read, \'name     |                                   |
| names\' and I heard, \'name       |                                   |
| them.\' I don\'t know to what     |                                   |
| extent I should correct her       |                                   |
| diphthongs, because there must be |                                   |
| native speakers who pronounce     |                                   |
| them the same as her. Do you know |                                   |
| who such natives are, not         |                                   |
| distinguishing \'whale\' and      |                                   |
| \'well\', for example?            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I explain vocabulary she is       |                                   |
| interested in, giving definitions |                                   |
| and expamples in English. This is |                                   |
| still easy for me. \[Easier than  |                                   |
| teaching big classes of           |                                   |
| beginning, unmotivated            |                                   |
| students.\] After all I did ace   |                                   |
| the Verbal Reasoning section of   |                                   |
| the GRE. But it is interesting    |                                   |
| having to generate this kind of   |                                   |
| material on demand, giving my     |                                   |
| verbal skills a work-out,         |                                   |
| something I feel like I haven\'t  |                                   |
| been doing for a long time since  |                                   |
| copy-editing at the newspaper     |                                   |
| perhaps.                          |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| One thing I did have trouble with |                                   |
| however was one question about    |                                   |
| mistakes connecting cause and     |                                   |
| effect. The question presents a   |                                   |
| short passage about the           |                                   |
| misattribution of the cause of    |                                   |
| sickness resulting from food      |                                   |
| poisoning to the most             |                                   |
| distinctively flavored food eaten |                                   |
| at the meal. It says children are |                                   |
| particularly susceptible to this  |                                   |
| mistake.                          |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| It then asks which of the         |                                   |
| answers, if true, best supports   |                                   |
| the argument. We could not see    |                                   |
| which one is supposed to be the   |                                   |
| correct answer.                   |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| The question of linking cause and |                                   |
| effect is interesting to me in my |                                   |
| work as a teacher. \[I feel like  |                                   |
| I\'m wrapped in cotton wool.      |                                   |
| Nothing I do has an effect.\]     |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| The question: Someone who gets    |                                   |
| sick from eating a meal will      |                                   |
| often develop a strong distate    |                                   |
| for the one food in the meal that |                                   |
| had the most distinctive flavor,  |                                   |
| whether or not that food caused   |                                   |
| the sickness. This phenomenon     |                                   |
| explains why children are         |                                   |
| especially likely to develop      |                                   |
| strong aversions to some foods.   |                                   |

| Which one of the following, if    |                                   |
| true, provides the strongest      |                                   |
| support for the explanation?      |                                   |

| A. Children are more likely than  |                                   |
| adults to be given meals composed |                                   |
| of food lacking especially        |                                   |
| distinctive flavors. B. Children  |                                   |
| are less likely than adults to    |                                   |
| see a connection between their    |                                   |
| health and the foods they eat. C. |                                   |
| Children tend to have more acute  |                                   |
| taste and to become sick more     |                                   |
| often than adults do. D. Children |                                   |
| typically recover more slowly     |                                   |
| than adults do from sickness      |                                   |
| caused by food.                   |                                   |
