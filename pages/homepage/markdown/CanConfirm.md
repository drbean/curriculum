% "Can confirm"? Why "can"

| drbean	"I can confirm that $1,000 has been deposited into my account."
| drbean	Why not, "I hereby confirm that" or some equivalent other speech act?
| papna	drbean: You can rephrase anything
| Loshki	drbean: it depends, in part, on how formal you wish to sound. 
| drbean	From all the duckduckgo hits for 'I can confirm', it seems this is the way to use 'confirm' when it's you who's doing it.
| drbean	I guess it is the speech act of confirming (using 'can'), like 'Can you close the window' is the speech act of requesting (using 'can').
| drbean	To confirm something is to convey to someone that something they suspect/fear/hope to be the case is in fact the case.
| drbean	Other uses of 'I can' in speech acts?
| drbean	'You can sit here if you like,' is an offer.
| drbean	'I can get you a drink, if you like,' is an offer.
| drbean	'I can confirm that, if you like,' is NOT an offer?
| drbean	'I can *confirm* that, if you like' has the possible meaning of 'I can *check* that, if you like'?
| drbean	sloppily speaking, I guess a sloppy speaker could.
