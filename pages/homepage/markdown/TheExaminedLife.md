Q: How do I examine myself.

A: Being a teacher, especially if self-consciousness is a problem to overcome, will do it. If teaching someone whose native language isn't your own language won't do it (why are these bozos having trouble with this, something that came naturally to me and that I neither remember not ever having known nor ever having learned), nothing will.

Q: How good is the picture I form of 'you'?

A: The answer is drawn from

Q: Is self-confidence a good thing?

A: Feeling that you have agency and that you are in control may be misleading you, especially if you are unskilled and not in control. See
[SelfEfficacy](SelfEfficacy.html).
