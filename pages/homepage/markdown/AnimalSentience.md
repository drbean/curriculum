% Justin Leiber says:

Montaigne claims consciousness for spiders and ants. Singer and Clarke deny it to sponges. Singer draws the line between the shrimp and oyster. While accusing others, he slides by the case of insects, spiders and bacteria, who apparently and rather conveniently do not feel pain. But the intrepid Midgley is willing to speculate about the subjective experience of tapeworms. Nagel drew the line at flounders and wasps, but now speaks of the inner life of cockroaches.

Apparently, he did this in Leiber, J. “Cartesian” linguistics?. Philosophia 18, 309–346 (1988). https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02380646
