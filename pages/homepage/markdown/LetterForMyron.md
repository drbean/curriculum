To whom it may concern,

This is an unsolicited letter of recommendation for Cheng Fang 
Chiu (邱晟芳), AKA Myron, whom I taught English composition in 
his final year in the Teaching Chinese as a Foreign Language 
program at National United University in Taiwan. I am eager for 
him to get a job teaching Chinese to Speakers of Other Languages, 
because I think teaching your language to people who don't speak 
it opens up ways of thinking not available to other people.

Talking about time management apps, talking about evaluating the
NUU program, talking about his liking for the Australian lifestyle,
he impressed with a maturity, an articulateness, a communicativeness
that exceeded that of the other students.

He has also continued to engage with me over the 18 months since the class 
ended, showing a consistency in his interest in intercultural communication.

Finally, he is easy-going and gets along with other people.

You can't go wrong choosing him. Grab hold of him and don't let
him go.

Sincerely,

| Greg Matheson, Lecturer (retired),
| National United University
