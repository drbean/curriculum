% Too much of a good thing

The [Dunning-Kruger effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) says people don't have great insight into their abilities. The unskilled think they are doing OK (relatively). The ones doing OK are less confident.

The over-confidence you have with feelings of relative
[self-efficacy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/self-efficacy),
as promoted by Bandura,
are a characteristic of being unskilled.

There is a negative correlation of your real ability with the error in your rosy estimate of that ability and your feeling of relative self-efficacy.

Searching for 'dunning-kruger self-efficacy', Google's AI Overview today tells me,

    [I]ndividuals with low ability in a specific area tend 
    to overestimate their competence, while those with high 
    ability may underestimate their skills, impacting 
    self-efficacy. 

When I refresh, it tells me,

    [I]ndividuals with low competence in a specific area 
    tend to overestimate their abilities (self-efficacy), 
    while those with high competence often underestimate 
    their skills.

When I add 'bandura' to the search, as 'dunning-kruger bandura 
self-efficacy', it tells me,

    [The] effect, where unskilled individuals overestimate their 
    abilities, can be seen as a potential issue in relation 
    to Bandura's concept of self-efficacy ..

Make a mistake. Try it, you'll like it.
