% How do I (and the genes) put it?

I don't understand what a gene is. Is it a physical thing or is it information encoded in DNA which is then 'expressed' in some physical thing where 'transcription' is also involved? Compare and contrast with language and thought. The image I have of this 'expression' is breast milk expression, rather than impression/expression.
