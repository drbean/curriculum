% How do I (and the genes) put it?

I don't understand what a gene is. Is it a physical thing or is it information encoded in DNA which is then 'expressed' in some physical thing where 'transcription' is also involved? Compare and contrast with language and thought. The image I have of this 'expression' is breast milk expression, rather than impression/expression.

Is 'expression' an expression without meaning? No need is felt for a concept to explain the relation of software and hardware or the role of information in computation. What was Francis Crick thinking when he, apparently, introduced the expression, 'expression'?
