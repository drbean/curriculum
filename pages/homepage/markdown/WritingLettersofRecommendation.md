% 'WritingLettersofRecommendation - Kwiki'

I ask my students who want me to
write a letter of recommendation
for them, to give me a mind map
of the things they want me to
say, grouped into four areas:

-   English ability as I would
    have experienced
-   academic record in my class
-   personality/social skills as
    seen by other students and me
-   anecdote or story about
    interaction between me and
    the student

Writing a letter of
recommendation should not only be
an exercise for the writer, it
should be one for the subject of
the letter too: an exercise in
self-reflection, and questioning
who they are.
