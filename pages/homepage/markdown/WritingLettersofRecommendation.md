| I ask my students who want me to  |                                   |
| write a letter of recommendation  |                                   |
| for them, to give me a mind map   |                                   |
| of the things they want me to     |                                   |
| say, grouped into four areas:     |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| -   English ability as I would    |                                   |
|     have experienced              |                                   |
| -   academic record in my class   |                                   |
| -   personality/social skills as  |                                   |
|     seen by other students and me |                                   |
| -   anecdote or story about       |                                   |
|     interaction between me and    |                                   |
|     the student                   |                                   |

| Writing a letter of               |                                   |
| recommendation should not only be |                                   |
| an exercise for the writer, it    |                                   |
| should be one for the subject of  |                                   |
| the letter too: an exercise in    |                                   |
| self-reflection, and questioning  |                                   |
