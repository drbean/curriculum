% Microsoft 10 update prevents Windows 10 start

An old Trend Micro Virus Buster Cloud driver tmcomm.sys message of a PAGE_FAULT_IN_NONPAGED_AREA was breaking install of KB5021089 Windows 10 Version 22H2 update.

https://www.4900.co.jp/content/41464/ was helpful, but tmcomm.sys was being hidden, and I didn't realize.

I learned more about the Windows troubling shooting than I knew and cared to know and spent more time than I should.

But it will perhaps stand me in good stead in the future.
