| Students copied the pictures I    |                                   |
| distributed in the lesson and     |                                   |
| then together with a partner I    |                                   |
| assigned them, recorded outside   |                                   |
| class on tape a conversation as   |                                   |
| they tried to find how many       |                                   |
| differences there were between    |                                   |
| the pictures, without looking at  |                                   |
| each other\'s picture.            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I asked them to tell me what they |                                   |
| found difficult about the task    |                                   |
| and ways they helped themselves   |                                   |
| to make it easier.                |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| These ways included writing down  |                                   |
| what they recorded on to the      |                                   |
| tape. Many students looked at     |                                   |
| each others\' pictures. In the    |                                   |
| midterm and final exams, they had |                                   |
| to do it without looking, or      |                                   |
| using Chinese.                    |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| This was a successful genre of    |                                   |
| activity, but the logistics of    |                                   |
| grading the homework (collecting  |                                   |
| tapes, using tape recorders,      |                                   |
| finding the right place on the    |                                   |
| tape, listening to the tapes,     |                                   |
| deciding if they had found a      |                                   |
| difference or not) led me to move |                                   |
