% This I believe

Ahead of a workshop with futurist
[Sohail Inayatallah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2h2Z85lA0NU).
I'm afraid he's going to ask me who I am.

So, I think I want to say:

- I want to do things differently.

- My opposition to money.

The worst arts are architecture and movie-making
because of money.

- I want to exploit, not people, but opportunities,
slip through the cracks and get something for nothing.

The obverse of this is gratitude for people's charity.
