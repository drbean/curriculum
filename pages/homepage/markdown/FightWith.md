Some people express doubts about the 'anomalous' use of 'with' to mean 'in opposition with', rather than 'in concert with'.

Apparently Japanese has the same 2 separate meanings for とたたかう that English does for 'fight with'.

	'George Orwell fought with the International Column during the Spanish Civil War"
	'Later, England fought with Germany during WWII.'

But in Japanese you can't use both senses in the same sentence, apparently.

	'America fought with England and with Germany during WWII.'
