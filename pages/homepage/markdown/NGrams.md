% Comparing Frankenstein, Sherlock Holmes and Einstein renown

[https://books.google.com/ngrams/](https://books.google.com/ngrams/) finds more instances of 'Frankenstein' than 'Albert Einstein' and 'Sherlock Holmes' in books since 1990. Removing the latter 2's first names from its search, there is a much greater number for 'Holmes' and then 'Einstein' than for 'Frankenstein'. 'Holmes's percentages had been going up before 1880 before Sherlock Holmes appeared and have been going down since 1900 after his presence was established, so they must be the result of other people having the same name
