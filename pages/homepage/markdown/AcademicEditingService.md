### The pitch

I am offering an academic paper editing service, "the next best thing to a journal editor at your side ON your side."

Let me edit your paper. I do a good job because of

i) my English language skills (see my old GRE scores in my resume),
ii) the care with which I express myself, and
iii) my desire to understand even difficult material.

### Testimonials

* I highly recommend Greg's professionalism in editing--呂宜玲
* I appreciate Greg's editing ability and discussions of English grammar--董東錦

Please feel free to [contact me](mailto:drbean@freeshell.org), just to say, "Hello", even if you don't want me to edit your work.

### Writing advice

Let me share two excellent writing sites:

1. [GMU's writing guides](https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides), developed for college students, have good advice about the process of writing.

	See the guides on the academic [IMRAD](https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/writing-an-imrad-report) paper's

* [Introduction](https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/imrad-reports-introductions#containerZoneContentArea),
* [Method](https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/writing-an-imrad-report#containerZoneContentArea),
* [Results](https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/writing-an-imrad-report#containerZoneContentArea) and
* [Discussion](https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/imrad-reports-conclusions#containerZoneContentArea) sections:

2. [Academic Phrasebank](http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/) gives you the words to say what you are trying to do at certain points in your paper.

* In the Introduction: [Introducing work](http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/introducing-work/) and [Referring to sources](http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/referring-to-sources/)
* In the Method: [Describing methods](http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/describing-methods/)
* In the Results: [Reporting results](http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/reporting-results/)
* In the Discussion: [Discussing findings](http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/discussing-findings/) and [Writing conclusions](http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/writing-conclusions/)


	For example, [hedges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedge_(linguistics)), as explained by the GMU guide to [softening claims about research findings](https://writingcenter.gmu.edu/guides/hedges-softening-claims-in-academic-writing#containerZoneContentArea):

	The Academic Phrasebank suggests when you want to be [cautious about interpreting results](http://www.phrasebank.manchester.ac.uk/using-cautious-language/), you can say:

~~~~~
	These data must be interpreted with caution because …
	These results therefore need to be interpreted with caution.
~~~~~

### Pricing

People in Taiwan have been very generous to me, I have for many years benefited from free software and I always appreciate vendors who offer good service at low prices, so I want to return the favor by keeping to the rock-bottom recommended 科技部 rate of 0.5元 per word.

Thanks for reading this far. I look forward to hearing from you.
