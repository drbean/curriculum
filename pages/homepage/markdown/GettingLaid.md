% Laying or Getting Laid

The intention with this little skit is to get you to discover two very similar words which form a transitive/intransitive pair. There are only very few such pairs in English.

	Boswell: I must lay Jean-Jacques Rousseau's mistress.

		(Later) I got laid!

	Dr Johnson: Wrong! Certainly, if Mlle Boustrop lay with 
		you, then you lay with her.

		But, the transitive 'lay' is not reflexive. If 
		a bird lays an egg, the egg gets laid, not the 
		bird.

		If you laid Mlle Boustrop, it's she who got
		laid not you.

	Boswell: I'm sorry.

		But what about Joseph Addison's prayer?

		"Now I lay me down to sleep.
		Pray the Lord my soul to keep."

		'Lay' is reflexive there.

	Dr Johnson: (Tourette tic)

Did you find the very similar intransitive verb which forms a pair with 'lay'? Dr Johnson uses it in the past tense, in which form it is homophonic with the present tense of 'lay'.
