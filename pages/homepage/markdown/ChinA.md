% China--the new Asian threat?

My mother did a semester of Chinese and 
I can remember
[China Reconstructs][1]
[1]: https://www.marxists.org/subject/china/china-reconstructs/index.htm
in the 1950/60's coming in the mail and 
having vaguely sympathetic views of 
Chinese communism.

Wait. I think it was a different magazine
[China Pictorial][2]
[2]: https://archive.org/details/ChinaPictorial/CP1969-01/page/n37/mode/2up
Anyway, it was like a picture magazine,
but printed, not on glossy paper, but
on matt paper.

This experience undoubtedly is connected 
to my interest in Chinese characters, 
but, after visiting China in 1992 in an 
attempt to re-enter Korea, and now living 
in Taiwan, I am generally unsupportive 
of anything to do with China and the 
Chinese government.
