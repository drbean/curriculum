% How to do it

I wrote a script, post.sh to publish a post on my homepage, http://drbean.sdf.org, for use in a pipeline that then posted the content, composed on the command line, using toot to https://mastodon.sdf.org. It just marshalled various pandoc, svn and lftp operations from the command line I was already using to post to my homepage, but getting it to do this unattended required some tightening up. I committed it to my github curriculum repo in the pages dir, but it is of limited use to anyone else.



Me at
<form action='https://mastodon.sdf.org/@drbean'>
<button type='submit' class='btn'>
<img src='./mastodon.svg'
alt='https://joinmastodon.org/logos/wordmark-black-text.svg'
style='width:100px;height:50px'/>
</button></form>
