% Can't say anything about you, and saying it

How good is the picture I form of 'you'?

It's difficult, because 'you' is out there, but in the mind, behind the bone curtain, a confusion of complicated impulses and motivations, represented by language (a blunt instrument), lack of candor and kayfabe postures.

And my drawing of the picture 'you' present is limited by my boneheadedness, wishful thinking and inadequate EQ.

Compare and contrast with the picture I have of people on the Internet and of me represented to me by my self-image.
