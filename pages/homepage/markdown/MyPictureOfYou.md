% Cannot say anything, and saying it

How good is the picture I form of 'you'? Because 'you' is out there, but in the mind, behind the bone curtain, a confusion of complicated impulses and motivations, represented by language (a blunt weapon), lack of candor and kayfabe poses, and my drawing of the picture 'you' present is limited by my prejudices and lack of EQ. Compare and contrast with the picture I have of you on the Internet and me represented to me by my self-image 1/2
