% What's it with "so as to"?

I'm coming across people using _so as to_ to mean _with the purpose of_. I don't like it.

I would just replace _so as to_ with _to_, but perhaps there is a slight difference in meaning. Or is it just a formal expression with the same meaning as _to_?

	We took the back streets so as to avoid the traffic.

	We took the back streets to avoid the traffic.

	We took the back streets, avoiding the traffic.

The first stresses the instrumentality of the back street choice, emphasizing the avoiding of traffic over the taking of the back streets? Perhaps?

The second doesn't do that. It establishes a purpose relationship between taking the back streets and avoiding the traffic.

	A: Why are we taking the back streets?
	B: Because that way, we can avoid the traffic.

If taking the back streets doesn't actually save them any time, could you say:

	We took the back streets so as to avoid the traffic, but it didn't save us any time.

Seems like they're saying they achieved their objective, but then that they didn't achieve their objective. On the other hand, the second is not saying anything about an objective being achieved.

	We took the back streets to avoid the traffic, but it didn't save us any time.

The third form, replacing _to avoid_ with _avoiding_ is not talking about an objective at all, but the result of the action. The aim of taking the back streets could have been avoiding the traffic. Or it may not have been. In any case, they avoided the traffic.	

	I went outside in the rain, getting wet.

That probably doesn't mean the intention was to get wet.

	* I went outside in the rain to get wet.

But the purpose of going outside COULD have been to get wet.

	I went outside in the rain to get wet and cool off.
