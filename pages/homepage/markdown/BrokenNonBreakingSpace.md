% Under cover of clipboard

Lost in translation

Copy and paste via the clipboard from the browser to a screen mintty terminal session, non-breaking spaces, (U+00A0) were turning into ASCII spaces (U0020).

I couldn't see! Not hiding in plain sight, but not quacking like a duck, either. 'curl' spoke the truth, saving to a file.

The culprit is the browser, clipboard, screen or mintty?

Copy and paste via the clipboard from the browser to a screen cygwin terminal session, non-breaking spaces, (U+00A0) were turning into ASCII spaces (U+0020). (But also to Windows 'cmd'). I couldn't see. Not hiding in plain sight, but not quacking like a duck, either. 'curl' spoke the truth. The culprit is the browser, clipboard, screen or mintty?

Apparently this is a 15-year known browser bug. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47135608/no-break-spaces-are-turned-into-normal-spaces-after-copy-paste
