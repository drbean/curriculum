% Winning minds and influencing people

Tanner Greer has an
[excellent post](https://scholars-stage.org/why-chinese-culture-has-not-conquered-us-all/)
on what cultural exports China needs to 
promote if it is to engender 
China-friendly attitudes internationally.

He concludes that Chinese engagement
with the West is what is most likely to 
work.

He cites palpable excitment in young 
conservative American circles created
by Chinese interest in Leo Strauss and
Carl Schmitt.

I think this is exactly right.

Peking opera and bound feet, 
Marxism-Leninism-Mao Tse-tung Thought
and opium is not going to do it.

But Chinese takes on tired Western 
thinking (in my case, not conservative 
thinking) *ARE* interesting.

Two points

:	1. The Chinese government should 
give David Ownby a medal for his English 
translations of essays by Chinese public 
intellectuals at
[https://readingthechinadream.com](https://readingthechinadream.com)

	Of course, it is not going to 
do that because most of them are subtly, 
or not so subtly, critical of the 
government.

	Because of his skill as a 
translator, they don't read as if they 
were originally in Chinese. And the 
thinking of the writers is Western, but 
with a twist.

	I can't put my finger on what 
makes them interesting.

:	2. Did the
[Reforms and Opening-up 
program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reforms_and_Opening_Up)
make an unholy bargain trading the minds 
of the Chinese people for Chinese 
prosperity?

	With commerce for China having 
the same role militarism had in Japan 
modernizing/Westerning the Japanese mind?

東道西器?

	I don't think it means what you 
think it means.
