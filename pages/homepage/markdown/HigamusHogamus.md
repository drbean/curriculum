% Waking up--the road to error

In a waking reverie, pioneering psychologist, William James, thought with

| Higamus, Hogamus
| Woman are monogamous
| Hogamus, higamus
| Men are polygamous

<p>
he had discovered a great truth.

But later, in the light of day, reflecting on that opinion, he dismissed it.

PS. My apparently mistaken understanding, due to reading a HJ Eysenck popular exposition of pysychology for a lay audience, that this was an experience of James, leads me to suspect that there may be something in claims that Eysenck's scientific work was (also) a 'figment of his imagination' or the product of a fevered mind.

His teacher, Cyril Burt is also known as the serial perpetrator of scientific fraud.

According to

many of his publications are "unsafe".

Is psychology (also) a scientific fraud?
