| Devising a speaking and listening |                                   |
| course, I would first consider my |                                   |
| objectives. These would depend on |                                   |
| who the students were. With       |                                   |
| perfect students, the objectives  |                                   |
| become obvious. Such students     |                                   |
| would teach themselves through    |                                   |
| interaction in English with me.   |                                   |
| As a native-speaker, I would be   |                                   |
| trying to communicate at a deep   |                                   |
| level with them, trying to        |                                   |
| establish bonds with them, and    |                                   |
| trying to initiate them into the  |                                   |
| culture of the English speaker.   |                                   |
| With them, I could use a perfect  |                                   |
| methodology, a communicative,     |                                   |
| task-based approach, that         |                                   |
| emphasized autonomous learning    |                                   |
| and working in groups.            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| With the students I have been     |                                   |
| teaching for the last seven years |                                   |
| however, such good students are   |                                   |
| few. These students lack          |                                   |
| confidence, don\'t enjoy          |                                   |
| interacting in English and are    |                                   |
| not prepared to take risks        |                                   |
| communicating. My goals with such |                                   |
| students would be to promote      |                                   |
| confidence they can use English   |                                   |
| to communicate, alleviate the     |                                   |
| stress they feel communicating in |                                   |
| English and encourage more        |                                   |
| adventurousness speaking and      |                                   |
| listening to the language.        |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| At the same time, I would be      |                                   |
| trying to keep these students     |                                   |
| on-task, preventing them from     |                                   |
| finding opportunities to avoid    |                                   |
| using the language, or to avoid   |                                   |
| confronting their problems with   |                                   |
| language learning, by sleeping or |                                   |
| not coming to class, or not       |                                   |
| participating in class            |                                   |
| activities, for example.          |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Thus my aim would be a            |                                   |
| light-hearted, fun course, but at |                                   |
| the same time, to communicate I   |                                   |
| had firm expectations that all    |                                   |
| students would make the effort to |                                   |
| learn.                            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I would try to lighten the        |                                   |
| deadening effect of midterm and   |                                   |
| final exams by making them        |                                   |
| shorter and more informal. Having |                                   |
| no assessment, on the other hand, |                                   |
| would permit students to avoid    |                                   |
| confronting their language        |                                   |
| learning problems, so I would     |                                   |
| have 4 informal,                  |                                   |
| speaking-and-listening exams in   |                                   |
| weeks 4,9,13 and 18, each worth   |                                   |
| 15 percent of the grade.          |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| For classes of good students,     |                                   |
| this informal exam would be a     |                                   |
| [JigSaw](JigSaw.html) activity.   |                                   |
| For classes of unmotivated        |                                   |
| students (and non-English majors  |                                   |
| perhaps), it would be a pair      |                                   |
| dictation activity.               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Thus these 4 exams would split    |                                   |
| the semester up into 4 sections.  |                                   |
| In these 4 sections, the language |                                   |
| and cultural material I would be  |                                   |
| trying to teach would be          |                                   |
| exemplified in 2 or 3 dialogues   |                                   |
| that were similar to each other,  |                                   |
| in terms of grammar or language   |                                   |
| function, or in terms of cultural |                                   |
| content.                          |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| The good classes would use the    |                                   |
| material to do communicative      |                                   |
| tasks, and other activities       |                                   |
| oriented to language use, for     |                                   |
| non-language ends, eg give        |                                   |
| advice, or solve puzzles. The     |                                   |
| basic classes would practice the  |                                   |
| material in different contexts,   |                                   |
| eg dictation, context-spotting,   |                                   |
| definitions, and quizzes, that    |                                   |
| is, in activities directed at     |                                   |
| language usage.                   |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| The dialogues I would choose      |                                   |
| would be interesting because of   |                                   |
| conflict between the              |                                   |
| protagonists, which was resolved, |                                   |
| or was expressed, for example.    |                                   |
| Although the language might be    |                                   |
| simple, the language functions    |                                   |
| would be subtle and layered, with |                                   |
| complex meanings.                 |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| The dialogues would thus be about |                                   |
| complex human interactions,       |                                   |
| expressive of the deep            |                                   |
| relationships people have with    |                                   |
| each other, even though the       |                                   |
| language itself might be quite    |                                   |
| simple.                           |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Usually, I take my dialogs,       |                                   |
| specifically, and language and    |                                   |
| cultural materials, in general,   |                                   |
| from the textbooks I am given, or |                                   |
| have acquired. I don\'t have any  |                                   |
| strong preferences.               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| With the dialogs, I am doing most |                                   |
| of my own materials development   |                                   |
| at the moment. Dictation and the  |                                   |
| use of cards is a distinctive     |                                   |
| feature of my courses. Dictation  |                                   |
| can be boring, but with the       |                                   |
| computer-generated materials I    |                                   |
| have developed where students     |                                   |
| have to fill in letters, rather   |                                   |
| than words, the students          |                                   |
| generally find it interesting.    |                                   |
| This is because there are limited |                                   |
| choices and feedback is precise   |                                   |
| and generally quick. There is     |                                   |
| less confusion. The confusion     |                                   |

| Class dictations where 1 or 2     |                                   |
| students read the passage and the |                                   |
| rest of the class, tries to fill  |                                   |
| in the letters is, surprisingly   |                                   |
| quite interesting to my           |                                   |
| lower-level students at the       |                                   |
| moment.                           |                                   |

| I wouldn\'t use dictation as much |                                   |
| with higher-level students. With  |                                   |
| them, communication, or use of    |                                   |
| language for non-language ends,   |                                   |
| in other words, listening and     |                                   |
| speaking AND thinking, must be an |                                   |
| objective. With lower-level       |                                   |
| students, they may resist more    |                                   |
| than encoding (into speech) and   |                                   |
| decoding (into a representation   |                                   |
| of speech), the psychological     |                                   |
