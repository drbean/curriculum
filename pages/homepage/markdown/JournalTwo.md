% Second week of getting them to do it

### Conversation classes 3/1,2 written 3/2

I can leave out the fourth year class I think. There I am not particularly trying to concentrate on getting them to think about language.

I think I first got them into groups and wrote up the dialogue in the book, _Transformations_ with 12 content words (banking) in Chinese. We did listen-and-repeat a couple of times. Rather I took one role, they took other.

First time or so, I explained/gave very conversationally the English equivalents or explained where they were in the glossary (of course they were in the original dialogue too). I may have asked them to work in pairs and do the dialogue and I may have recorded this.

Finally, I asked them to write the English equivalents on the board. This took the first hour. I must have done management things like explain the seating chart and ask about students not in the class.

In the second hour, I started off with US money in the book, using pictures from another book and also a knock-out competition between the groups based on a listening quiz from the same book I had used with the third-year classes. It made use of Tim _Newfield_'s pointing to two sides of the room to distinguish answers A and B. It is better than hands in the air, but it is still often unclear which direction they're pointing. I also have to cut off people who are slow to point. Otherwise, everyone is just pointing in the same direction and no-one is forced out.

I also did ltter addresses in English, giving letter address homework and alphabetical order with example (was to be quiz), cardinal numbers for dates.

In the third year classes, the aim was to get some pairs to do some recording and to do a quiz and to talk about ways to learn. The second class was better, but I was satisfied with the first class too.

In the first class, I started off with talking about my experience with Yoko reading a children's book. How listening to someone reading is interesting. How I imagined them becoming good speakers by reading to a partner. (This is what the dialogue taping is! Reading into a tape. At least at the start.) They were very inattentive. I wondered if they thought children's books were uncool. But I read all the way through. Then I explained how the taping would work.
