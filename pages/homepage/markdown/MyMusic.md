| This incident must have happened  |                                   |
| when I was about 7-8. One night,  |                                   |
| my mom and dad let me stay up a   |                                   |
| bit later than my younger         |                                   |
| brothers, who were 6 and 3. They  |                                   |
| went to bed at 8 pm, but I sat up |                                   |
| with my mom and dad. I felt very  |                                   |
| proud of being a big boy.         |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| My dad likes classical music a    |                                   |
| lot, and I had looked at some     |                                   |
| books about classical music that  |                                   |
| he had. I read something about a  |                                   |
| composer called Schumann.         |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I started to talk to my parents   |                                   |
| about Schumann. But I pronounced  |                                   |
| the word, \'skamen,\' rather than |                                   |
| \'shuman.\' I probably thought    |                                   |
| that *sch* should be pronounced   |                                   |
| as in the word \'school.\'        |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| My mom and dad laughed at me. I   |                                   |
| suddenly lost the feeling that I  |                                   |
| was grown up. I had mixed         |                                   |
| feelings about being laughed at.  |                                   |
| In some ways, I liked them to     |                                   |
| laugh at me. In other ways, I     |                                   |
| didn\'t like them to laugh at me. |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I think probably I also had mixed |                                   |
| feelings about being grown up. I  |                                   |
| didn\'t think being grown up was  |                                   |
| such a great thing, perhaps.      |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I think I lost interest in music  |                                   |
| from that point until I became    |                                   |
| about 19, when I started getting  |                                   |
| interested in music again. I      |                                   |
| wanted to get involved with new   |                                   |
| music, however. I wanted to find  |                                   |
| music that was different than the |                                   |
| music my father liked and other   |                                   |
| people liked too.                 |                                   |
