My http://drbean.sdf.org/toeflic TOEFL/TOEIC Test site has two fake personas, besides myself.

One for the admin login is 'Ed Min', a homophone of 'admin' for merry/marry/Mary merger speakers. 'Min' is the US's 5026th most common surname.

The other for using it without making an id, is 'Tess Staker' for the 'test' id, password 'Testing123'. 'Tess Staker' is a homophone of 'test taker' in normal speech. 'Staker' is the 18,849th most common one.

Invite 'Ed Min' and 'Tess Staker' onto your site.
