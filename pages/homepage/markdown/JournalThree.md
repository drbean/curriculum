### 3C

## Roles

* A: 2 speakers
* B: 2 coaches
* C: 1 recorder
* D: 2 secretaries
* E: 2 reporters
* F: 3 judges

Remember talking about feedback.

Spent 1st hour telling everyone what their role was using OHP. Everyone's seat and their letter. 2nd hour: p96 Apology

During break, Bobo asked to change group and work with Alice. I said no. Someone else was talking to me but I forgot who. Ruby? Then 40 minutes of pandemonium again. (3 tape recorders) (I didn't record again. Problem with Walkman). Last 15 minutes I got secretaries in a group in front to write (problems) on board. I wrote (example problem). They couldn't think (of problems). I changed it to good things about the activity & changed my problem to good thing. (See copied problems). While they thought I tried to do p92 Listen and Repeat: Halves of room, A me, B me. Pairs. (Dialog was about feedback, but did my comments go over their heads?)

Gave homework in last seconds: Why did I ask you to record conversations. Not good feeling at end. Good feeling about 'voice sounds funny'

## 3C --Problem reports-- Good things about

1. People talked about recording.
2. Listen to my sound from radio is funny.
3. -
4. -


### 3D

Essentially same as 3C. (I wonder if 3D is more favorably disposed to me) Same 1st hour talking (feedback, Momotaro story) role allocation. 2nd hour got judges going better I think. I got F to the front & asked them to walk round & give 3,2,1 (see problem reports) and judges wrote.

I did p92 again. No quiz. Nothing to write in gradebook.

Homework: They did tapes and 3C did more than 3D. Perhaps they are more willing to learn. I was surprised by the difference between class and tapes done for homework.

## 3D problem reports

1. People didn't know what to do.
2. We don't know what do you mean.
3. We feel so boring.
4. We don't know what do you say.
5. We don't know you speak.
