[Terry Riley](http://www.terryriley.net/): No music, No life (2023)

No wonder.

In conversation with
[Joe Hisaishi](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E4%B9%85%E7%9F%B3%E8%AD%B2)
on national TV in Japan in September, 2023:

**Hisaishi:** A long time playing music, but still things not understood. A lot of things to do. I wonder if Terry feels the same way.

**Riley:** No, it's .. you'll never finish understanding music, because it's the Universe itself. It's just like the Universe. Music is the best example we have, I think, to understand our place in the whole cosmos. So we won't understand it. We'll just keep, keep doing it.

**Dr Bean:** With the end of music, science is doing a pretty good job of understanding the universe.
