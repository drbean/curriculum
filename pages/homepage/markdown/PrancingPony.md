% Disparaging a politician--How is it done?

:	I remember someone disparaging a politician who had been photographed on a horse in cowboy attire, as 'prancing around' in a 'cowboy suit' on ..

Before I google for the sentence, how can a horse (actually the politician through the horse) be disparaged?

A 'thoroughbred'? Wait, I think it was 'pony'!

Why is 'pony' disparaging?

:	I can't find on google or duckduckgo the original quote.

	Sorry, I'm conflating 2 different episodes. The politician was photographed on a horse, but the disparagement was of something that occurred on a different occasion at a political rally, where he was said to be 'prancing around on a stage in a cowboy suit.'
