| Why do I like teaching?           |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I think it\'s because I have to   |                                   |
| think of two things at once. I    |                                   |
| have to think of communicating    |                                   |
| with the students, a cyclic       |                                   |
| language process which can be     |                                   |
| divided into three stages: 1) me  |                                   |
| talking to them and ensuring they |                                   |
| understand what I say, 2) them    |                                   |
| thinking and then responding to   |                                   |
| me, and 3) me understanding what  |                                   |
| they said. Stages 1) and 3) are   |                                   |
| under my control, but 2) the      |                                   |
| responsibility of the students,   |                                   |
| is not. This is very much the     |                                   |
| content side of teaching. The     |                                   |
| English language, used and        |                                   |
| discussed is the focus, for both  |                                   |
| me and them.                      |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| At the same time as this is       |                                   |
| happening, however, I have to be  |                                   |
| thinking of the teaching process. |                                   |
| That is, I have to be analyzing   |                                   |
| how what is happening is          |                                   |
| furthering their learning of      |                                   |
| English. This is not generally    |                                   |
| something which I discuss with    |                                   |
| the students, although ideally it |                                   |
| should be discussed.              |                                   |

| Expressed as an epigram: Inquiry  |                                   |
| into the nature of language       |                                   |
