% Who drew these?

The 40 facial sketches of students and a prof on this Space Science department page at http://www-ir.ess.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/member.html stopped after 2019. And the large number compared to present student enrolment of 15 suggests they were done by a staff member no longer in the department. A student would not have been there long enough to draw so many.
