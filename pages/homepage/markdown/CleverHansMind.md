% The Clever Hans in the machine

While I think machine learning apps, and chatbots in particular, are CleverHanses, I think interaction with them is why Clever Hans is important. We get the impression we are in the presence of mind, although we know we arenâ€™t. Recognizing they are not agents raises doubt, then, when interacting with real people, about their (and our own) agency.
