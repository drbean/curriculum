igithub is conducting its final svn brownout now, with 5 more hours to go.

From https://github.blog/changelog/2023-11-06-subver
sion-brownouts/

A 24 hour period beginning December 5, 2023 at 10:00
UTC / 2:00am Pacific and ending at the same time on
December 6

Trying to commit my svn working copy changes to github:

"GitHub has temporarily disabled Subversion support
as part of a planned brownout
in order to give you advance notice of the upcoming
permanent removal of
Subversion support on 2024-01-08.
Please see https://github.blog/2023-01-20-sunsetting
-subversion-support/ for details."

What to do?

Perhaps the thing to do is to set up a (lot of)
local svn repos on the machine I'm on, and make each
repo a clone of a github repo.

Or perhaps I can mirror my github repos on OSDN or
sourceforge subversion repos.
