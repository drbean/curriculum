But I do have better recordings. This can be used to crosscheck later.

# 3C May 10

*Started recording at start*

Started with part of song,

| Gotta gotta try to succeed
| Maybe if we try hard we will succeed
| Let's talk about it. Help each other
| Ask questions & find out

People were absent & drifting in because of Red Cross blood donations. Whether they sung along or not is debatable. I was satisfied however. I enjoyed it. This was more teaching music than teaching English so I'll leave it at that.

Then I started talking about how language learning can be rewarding ~~or~~ *and* discouraging. This led into Question 1 for a class survey:

	Do you find learning English rewarding (mostly)?

(I've forgotten the exact wording). And Question 2:

	Do you find learning Japanese rewarding (mostly)?

I think I tried to elicit a third, but couldn't (Can you think of a question, Lora, that you'd like to ask all of the class/know the answer for?), so third question was:

	Will you continue to learn Japanese and English after you graduate?

I think I then divided class into coop group seating arrangement & asked them to find how many out of 4 in their groups. This was about end of the first hour.

During break I drew up class survey answer grid. In second hour, I explained grid. Each of 3 groups in an area had responsibility to find out how many in the area for one question.

They did it better than last time. I was able to note some groups, eg in Area D, who were not ~~as good~~ doing work & "urge" them to find out and write up. I don't think I ~~took~~ gave participation points. Third groups divided their answers up into English and Japanese.

Then on p134, Whose things are these. Did some direct method stuff with 3 people's textbooks. Then into dialog & book's sock, sneakers, Walkman became things I sought out in class & tried to incorporate but not successfully (as usual).

I did this me & them, A & b & then got them to do it in pairs, but I've forgotten if I gave them participation points. I think I did. I did in 3D.

I told them this would be the homework. 6 lines rather than 4. Same rubric 3,2,1. Didn't talk about grammar, though probably will use it grade.

I've forgotten the end. Did I give quiz or not? I don't think so. How did it end?

Remembered after doing 3D journal. I did Jim Wingate's Chains. They had to sign circular & send around the area. Did it twice.

# 3D May 11 Written May 16

Turned tape on, started with same song written on board. Seemed more people there. Mostly quiet, but some singing, I think. I think it was shorter than 3C.

Then went on to like-language quiz. I think I changed from 'find rewarding' to 'liked'. I couldn't get any other questions, so went with same questions as 3C. I stressed number out of 4 in group & urged them to do it, but didn't give participation points, I think. 

Did we finish this by end of first hour? I don't think so, but am not sure. Did I call break 1-2 minutes early? Things are getting hazy. I can't remember ~~anything~~ much about getting students to survey other groups in area. The more I think, the more comes back. I wrote ~~things~~ grid on the board. I had to get down & mix to get them to ask other ~~members~~ groups. I think I did a participation point thing (or at least I should have). Actually, this would've been difficult in middle of activity (fairness considered), so perhaps I just did it for dialogue.

(I think my mind must have been on automatic pilot for this lesson. I forgot where I put my pens. At the end, I forgot to give homework. I couldn't write down participation points at the end for appropriate groups. I think I ~~did it~~ wrote points after another class. The end of the hour crept up on me & I can remember having trouble getting all my stuff together and getting out to the next class.)

I forgot to turn tape recorder on in the second hour too. Turned it on \_\_\_ minutes into the hour.

After writing down class survey results, I was surprised how few liked English and little more Japanese. I talked about this with them. More in 3C liked English. What did they say? They liked Japanese more. I checked that groups in fact didn't like English.

I guess we then started p134 dialog. I didn't do direct method thing with textbook first, but tried to incorporate things in classroom into dialogue illustration (Not successfully. One student didn't want me to use their sneakers.)

Substitution drills with participation points, starting at Back right hand corner.

~~Then~~ That's right. I forgot I did Chains from Jim Wingate Getting them to talk in English (PrenticeHall). I don't think they understood why. Once (?) nothing written on paper. Not all returned.

Then I did quiz similar to matchlines on p135, but got answers wrong.

Questions were like:

	Is this yours?		No, his is over there.
	Is this his coat?	Yes, it isn't mine.
	I think that's our dog over there.	No, it's not.
	Are those her children?	

I got at least one wrong, but collected answers ~~in groups~~ by individuals. Or did I send people to the front? I was confused at end.

### Liking English Japanese class survey

|	Question 1: Do you find learning English rewarding (mostly)?
|	Question 2: Do you find learning Japanese rewarding (mostly)?
|	Question 3: Will you continue to learn a) English and b) Japanese after you graduate?

  Class totals seem wrong.
