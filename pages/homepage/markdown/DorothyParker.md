% A portrait in contrasts

Turned off by the morbidity, if not the titillation, of her vision and the conventionality of her poetry, I yearn for the wholesomeness of her 'Candy is dandy, but liquor is quicker,' 'Better a bottle in front of me than a frontal lobotomy' and on learning of taciturn Pres Coolidge's death, 'How did they tell?'

I unfollowed dorothyparker@mas.to. They should let NAACP profit from people
who want to read her poetry by buying her books.

No, the real reason is reading her is titillating at the same time as being depressing, a combination of emotions I don't want.
