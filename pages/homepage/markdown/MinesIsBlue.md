% Mine's: A possessive of a possessive

	Your dog's collar is blue.
	Mine's is red.

Is that grammatical?

Or did I just invent a new grammatical category: the possessive form of a possessive pronoun?

Is there some connection with

	a friend of John's

I think it's more likely to occur than

	a friend of John

But it would be

	the collar of my dog

rather than

	the collar of my dog's
