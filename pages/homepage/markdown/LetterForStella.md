To Whom It May Concern,

When Stella first asked me for a
recommendation letter, I refused.
She and Sweety hadn't stood out
in the class. They didn't seem
very interested in writing about
their dreams or analyzing
themselves. I knew Stella dreamed
of being a dancer, but as far as
language was concerned, she often
took the easy option of
discussing problems in Japanese
with me rather than the more
challenging one of risking
failing to communicate with a
native speaker.

However, something must have been
kindled in Stella's heart (not
of course of my doing), because
her increased activity in writing
in her notebook and on the web

wiki/NewsPaper/index.cgi?StellaSh
iu>
through the 6-8 weeks to the end
of the semester showed me that
she could do the work, at the
same time as it convinced me that
I could honestly recommend her to
anyone unsure about whether to
accept her or not.

Although gentle, she seemed to
enjoy interacting with me. Her
sense of humor will stand her in
good stead. I hope she is able to
continue dancing, whether as a
career or a hobby. Though I never
saw her dance, I am convinced the
passion she showed for it will
allow her, as a doer, to acquit
herself honorably in this and
other activities she undertakes.

I heartily recommend Stella Shiu.

Sincerely,
