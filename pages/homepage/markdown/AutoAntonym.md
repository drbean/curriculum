% Same word--2 opposite meanings

### agent

'agent' is an [autoantonym or contronym ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contronym), meaning either a doer or actor with some amount of free will or control over events, or alternatively an entity controlled by a principal, but with some degree of independence.
[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agent](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agent)
doesn't recognize any tension between the meanings.

Compare and contrast the meanings.

A Mail User Agent is your email app. A Mail Transfer Agent is what moves the email between mail servers. In which sense is 'agent' being used? The first sense, rather than the second, perhaps? Or, both?

There is a commonality between the 2 meanings, but what is it? Before, a sense of ambiguity was not felt, I guess.

### belie

wkalt in the \#\#english channel on the freenode irc network, brought up
the issue of 'belie' meaning 2 opposite things

drbean

:   Is belie an autoantonym like 'cleave'?

    https://people.sc.fsu.edu/\~jburkardt/fun/wordplay/autoanto.html has
    a fun list of autoantonyms.

    'We secured all our silverware from thieves'

    We got it all from thieves?

    Or we prevented thieves from getting it?

    Burkart also has: "Few would argue that children are the chief
    beneficiaries."

    Most people agree that children are the chief beneficiaries?

    Or only a few people think that children are the chief
    beneficiaries?

    'Your comments belie a total lack of understanding'

    Your comments show a total lack of understanding?

    Or, despite your comments, the fact is that you understand nothing
    about the matter?

kurahaupo

:   I would secure the silverware against thieves, and then blackmail
    the thieves thereby securing hush money from them.

    or secure against theft

    drbean: I would take it as the latter, but I'm sure you could find
    examples of autoantonymical misuse

    "few would argue" = "most agree" (but sometimes the referent is
    ambiguous)

    Generally actions or observations belie statements, so using it
    backwards, where statements belie something else, is inviting
    abusive inversion of its meaning

    it's a matter of whether the argument is in favour of or against the
    proposition

    "Your comments { belie / give lie to } \[ your claim of \] a total
    lack of understanding." â†’ you're feigning ignorance but making
    comments that suggest that you know more than you're letting on.

drbean

:   If it were 'a few would argue that children are the chief
    beneficiaries,' ie, 'a few', rather than 'few', does that change the
    sense?

    I think it removes ambiguity. Then it means, most people think
    children AREN'T the chief beneficiaries and some people are
    disputing that.

kurahaupo

:   Considering "argue": arguing with or against a proposition generally
    means disagreeing with it; arguing for or that a proposition
    generally means agreeing with it. If few argue (either way) then
    most take the opposing position.

    (one of the odd cases where "with" and "against" give the same
    meaning)

    I think that derives from arguing with a proponent, by arguing
    against their proposition.

drbean

:   'argue' and 'agree' mix up their use of prepositions.

    If you argue with someone, you don't agree with them.

kurahaupo

:   Given the current fragility of prepositions in the English language
    as a whole, I would never be surprised to find otherwise competent
    native speakers uttering or writing confused autoantonyms

    drbean: I'm pretty sure that's what I said

    oh right, the same preposition

drbean

:   'fight' is like 'argue', using both 'with' and 'against' with the
    same meaning.

    Unlike 'argue', 'fight with' is an autoantonym?

    But isnt 'argue' an autoantonym?

    OK, 'few would argue' , not 'argue', is an antonym.

    For 'belie', wiktionary's sense 3: To contradict, to show
    (something) to be false. Synonym: give (the) lie to.

    is consistent with kurahaupo's 'actions or observations belie
    statements'

    Wiktionary's 4th sense (said perhaps nonstandard): To conceal the
    contradictory or ironic presence of (something).

    I guess this is the autoantonymical sense.

    The 5th snese (also said perhaps nonstandard): to show (something)
    to be present, particularly something deemed contradictory or
    ironic.

    This is an extension of sense 3, I think.

    "I would argue that children are the chief beneficiaries" can only
    mean, I argue for the position that children are the chief
    beneficiaries.

    How can it be that, "Few would argue that children are the chief
    beneficiaries," can be taken to mean the few are arguing AGAINST the
    position that children are the chief beneficiaries?

    I'm confused.

    An editor would change 'argue' to 'disagree,' arguing (!) bad word choice 
    only understandable because of the context?
