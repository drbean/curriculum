Cipollone testimony, where he is quoted as saying Herschmann was not 'formerly part of the White House Counsel Office.'

Herschmann's position is ambiguous, but #J6 dictation correctness not.

It could be. Eg, `Ye, the rapper formerly/formally known as Kanye West.`

Running with the fox and hunting with the hounds, anyone? Sitting on the fence is fun.

But not for the fox. The dogs are baying for blood.
