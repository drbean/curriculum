% Bingo as a game paradigm

[Bingo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo)
is essentially a simple matching exercise
where 

1. access by players to the first set of 
   items is under the control of a 
   caller, 
2. the second set of items is sampled 
   from a population of items in a 
   one-to-one correspondence with the 
   first set of items.
3. Some players have privileged sets, 
   which make it possible for them to be 
   Big Winners, while others may have 
   second-tier sets which allow them to 
   get Consolation Prizes, and losers 
   are those who went to sleep during 
   the calling.

The aim is to cross off all the items on 
your card before other players and be a 
Big Winner.  Suspense is created by 
being able to cross off some, but not 
all, items being called, and not knowing 
whether this means you're going to be a 
Big Winner or not.

The way bingo organizers can create 
these conditions, and prevent cheaters 
from just crossing off all their items 
and shouting 'Bingo', is to select 2 
items from the population, putting one 
in Big Winner sets and the other in the 
Consolation Prize sets, random sampling 
other items from the population for the 
2 sets of sets, and then calling all the 
prompts matching the items in the 
population in random order, leaving the 
2 clinchers to last.

Not just numbers and words can be used 
for prompts and matches. Any item 
suitable for a (simple) matching exercise
is good. For example, translations from 
L1 to L2, questions and answers, 
conversation adjacency pairs. Which 
means it is a very productive game 
paradigm.

Violation/relaxation of these procedures 
creates a different game/activity, eg
