% Japanese making mistakes with 'please'

warns Japanese in Korea to add 'for me' to 'Please X'. In a taxi, 'Please go to A for me,' not 'Please go to A'.

That's odd. Explicitness about power differentials, closeness and who benefits is baked into the ways Japanese has of doing things with words at all levels of formality.

How did 'please' in Japanese avoid this grammar program?

Koreans are more polite than Japanese?
