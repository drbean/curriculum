| It\'s not about me as the teacher |                                   |
| being responsible for the         |                                   |
| learners, ie all of the others in |                                   |
| the class, and they not being     |                                   |
| responsible for each other. No,   |                                   |
| everyone is a teacher. And        |                                   |
| everyone is responsible for their |                                   |
| partners\' learning, not just     |                                   |
| their own learning.               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| This is how important teaching    |                                   |
| is. Everyone is teaching. And     |                                   |
| everyone is learning.             |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| So to emphasize the interaction   |                                   |
| of responsibility I put the       |                                   |
| students into groups.             |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| That\'s the theory anyway.        |                                   |
