Ahead of a Korean visa run, I'm remembering telling Kim Myong-sik at the Korea Times 35 years ago that I had done Japan, and now I was doing Korea.

I had been in Japan for only 6 years!

I never felt confident about my achievement in Korea, where I was for twice that length of time. And even less confident about what I achieved in Taiwan where I was for twice the time I was in Korea.

I remember telling an expat in Korea who expressed his respect for Kim Myong-sik that he got up my nose. I don't remember where I picked up that expression. I didn't like him waving his copy in front of me when he put it on my desk. He was the best writer at the Korea Times.
