% Close inter-cultural personal relationships

Ahead of a Korean visa run, I'm remembering telling Kim Myong-sik at the Korea Times 35 years ago that I had done Japan, and now I was doing Korea.

I had been in Japan for only 6 years!

I never felt confident about my achievement in Korea, where I was for twice that length of time. And even less confident about what I achieved, or aware of my success, in Taiwan where I was for twice the time I was in Korea.

I never established with anyone in Korea or Taiwan the close personal relationships with people or culture that I did in Japan. They accepted me and I took this acceptance as indicating competence in things Japanese.

1. I remember telling an expat in Korea who expressed his respect for Kim Myong-sik that he got up my nose. I don't remember where I picked up that expression. I didn't like him waving his copy in front of me when he put it on my desk, but he was the best writer at the Korea Times. See some of his more recent

for the Korea Herald.

2. I remember feeling sad for students at a Korean hagweon hanging on my every word that I could not give them the love I thought at that moment to be important in learning a language. Learning in a love relationship.
