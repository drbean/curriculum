This is too late. It becomes a plan for the next week. In 3C (March 1), I started off with reading a story. The idea is to get them to think about methods of learning English. My reading of the story in Chinese (actually listening to Yoko read) was useful for me. I wanted them to think/investigate about ways they could take the initiative to learn English themselves. (I think I've forgotten something I did before that. Probably wrote on the board that we would be using tape recorders to record a dialogue from the book. Actually probably just talked about that.)

I found it difficult to focus their attention They were talking too, more than usual. It could have been something happening in the 8-10 lesson before this one. It could have been that they regarded the children's story about a humorous but monstrous badger/racoon (たぬし) and a mole (もぐら) as too childish and to be interested in it was uncool for 17-18 year olds.
