Editing a manuscript, I changed 'During 2009 to 2018, the proportions of falls at work in
+Taiwan and the United States were between 15.82% and 21.21%, and between
+24.35% and 26.97% among all occupational injuries, respectively'
to 'In Taiwan and the United States during the period 2009 to 2018, the proportions of falls at work rose from 15.82% to 21.21%, and from
-24.35% to 26.97% of all occupational injuries, respectively'
The previous sentence was 'The proportion of falls among all types of injury around the
-globe increased from 23.1% in 1997-2007 to 27.7% in 2007-2017'
The topic is the proportion of falls and the previous sentence was about where the falls increased: around the globe

Simplified, the sentence had been 'From 2009 to 2018, the proportion of falls at work in Taiwan and the United States increased ...'

I changed it to 'In Taiwan and the United States during the period 2009 to 2018 the proportion of falls at work increased ...'. I fronted the 2 countries, Taiwan and the United States.

Why? The previous sentence was about the increase in falls as a proportion of injuries around the world, establishing as a topic a global increase in falls. 

The sentence as it stood was OK, but I thought portraying the information about Taiwan and the United States as a development of the topic of a global increase in falls, by being examples of countries 

Doing this convinced me topic is a thing in English.

Michael Halliday wrote an English grammar in which he made out that English is a topic-comment language like Chinese and Japanese.

 I can't find the book in which he did this with a co-author.

 Readers could more easily see that the information in the second sentence is assimilable as cases in 2 example countries consistent with the global increase in falls established in the previous sentence.
