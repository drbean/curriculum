| It has been an incredible         |                                   |
| experience teaching here at       |                                   |
| Chinmin Institute of Technology.  |                                   |
| I have been disappointed a lot. I |                                   |
| have been overjoyed a lot.        |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| It is not usual to think of       |                                   |
| teaching as an exciting           |                                   |
| profession. But I\'ve found       |                                   |
| teaching here exciting.           |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| The students here are here        |                                   |
| because they couldn\'t get into   |                                   |
| any other school. That is, they   |                                   |
| are not here by choice, mostly.   |                                   |
| They don\'t like studying.        |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| This makes teaching them          |                                   |
| challenging.                      |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| But I like a challenge. A         |                                   |
| challenge is exciting, because    |                                   |
| there is a chance of success,     |                                   |
| even if mostly one fails!         |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| It feels good when I am able to   |                                   |
| get them to participate.          |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Generally they have not been      |                                   |
| served well by the education      |                                   |
| system, so they are reluctant to  |                                   |
| participate in teachers\'         |                                   |
| schemes.                          |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| When I do something that          |                                   |
| intrigues them, that makes them   |                                   |
| want to try and communicate about |                                   |
| that thing, I feel that probably  |                                   |
| they are learning something.      |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| This is a teachable moment.       |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Often they find it easier to talk |                                   |
| to each other in English than to  |                                   |
| talk with me. Of course, talking  |                                   |
| to each other in Chinese is       |                                   |
| easier than talking to each other |                                   |
| in English. But if I can create   |                                   |
| the right conditions I can get    |                                   |
| them to use English with each     |                                   |
| other.                            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| These conditions may include      |                                   |
| standing over them, so that they  |                                   |
| feel inhibited from speaking      |                                   |
| Chinese. But that comes with the  |                                   |
| territory of being a teacher.     |                                   |
| That is, sometimes it is          |                                   |
| unavoidable to force students to  |                                   |
| do things, like use English, when |                                   |
| they don\'t want to. It\'s good   |                                   |
| to use one\'s authority as a      |                                   |
| teacher as little as possible,    |                                   |
| however.                          |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
