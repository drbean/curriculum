In Japan, I'm not sleeping well.

I'm not a #coffee drinker, but I started drinking coffee here.

My #self-diagnosis. It's the coffee, but when I stop drinking coffee for a couple of days, I still wakeup.

I grew up believing I was sensitive to coffee. My parents drank coffee, we drank milo.

I can't shake the notion it's the coffee, rather than my precarious situation here.

My #prejudices confronting an #open-mind.

A little #self-diagnosis is a dangerous thing.
