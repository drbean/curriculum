% Wait, while we check your ID, OR while we are checking your ID?

I'm troubled by cloudflare's,

	'Please stand by while we are checking your browser'

And qutebrowser's,

	'Please wait, while qutebrowser is being installed' (from memory).

But nodejs gets it right with,

	'Please wait, while the Setup Wizard installs nodejs' (from memory).

I can't put my finger on what the problem is with 'while + present continuous'.
Because OK is,

	'While we are checking your browser, have fun identifying the obscure pictures of bicycles, or boats'

Or,

	'Drink a coffee, while the browser is being installed.'

Or,

	'While you're waiting, stretch your legs.'

'Waiting', 'standing by' is a state, and 'checking,' 'installing' are perfective verbs.

	'We installed/checked the browser yesterday, but didn't succeed in doing it.'

doesn't make sense.

	'We worked on the browser yesterday, but we couldn't get it to work.'

does make sense. But is

	'Please wait, while we are working on your browser'

any better than,

	'Please wait, while we are installing your browser.'

I don't think so.

	'Please wait, while we work on your browser.'

is good.
