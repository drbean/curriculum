% MS Word's Track Changes--Why I Don't Use It

To edit documents, I export Word files to plain text files, which I then
edit with a developer's editor (it has greater functionality for making
changes in the text), before importing them back into Word.

Unfortunately it means you can't use Track Changes to check my changes.
In your case, the changes I had to make were only sentence level ones,
and being able to see the 2 versions in the Word file itself would be
useful to you.

Sorry.

Use nano_Diff.html to check changes. It shows It's not a Word plugin, so you
have to copy from the file and paste into Word, which is not as .

Sometimes I have to change the order of sentences in paragraphs, add
my own sentences, or change many consecutive sentences because of
problems with the exposition. In that case, the large block of
changed text shown by Track Cbanges is too much for authors to take in
while going through the changes I made to their paper in order.

They need to sit down with the two versions in the original and edited
files and think about what to do with the changes.
