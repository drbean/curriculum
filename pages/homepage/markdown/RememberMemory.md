% Bringing up events more likely to have been forgotten

An example of my dredging up old memories, making me wonder if there is nothing that happened to me that I don't remember.

    The other day I was fastening the buttons of a shirt and having a little difficulty. The buttons were bigger than usual. I suddenly remembered 50 years ago acquiring a compositors print tray with Times Roman 14 point type, 2 points bigger than the usual 12 point.

Aside from the interest in it being an event many, many years ago I have not thought about for a long time, the other interest is why an event involving large printing type would pop into my memory and surprise me because of perceived irrelevance to buttoning a shirt?

I think the reason is that though printing type doesn't have anything to do with buttons (other than both being often fumbled), both events involved 'large sizes leading to possibly undesirable results': in the case of the buttons, being unable to button the shirt, and in the case of the type, an unprofessional look of the text on the page.

At the level at which I was thinking at the time, the association was surprising. But at a more abstract level, the association was natural. I accessed that more abstract level by thinking about the recall experience.

I am memorializing this recall experience to understand memory.

Another experience of remembering things at some distance from the event in hand:

    This morning I transferred some glassware from the draining rack to the dinnerware cabinet. My right hand was full with 2 or 3 glasses and glass flasks. I clutched a heavy whiskey glass to my chest with my open left arm. I thought I am in danger of dropping this whiskey glass as I open the cabinet door. I suddenly remembered the Aesop's fable where one animal is induced to drop a possession through the guile of another animal

I guess this association is less surprising than that between the buttons and the type. Aesop's fables never die. The association was 'failure to see the interconnection between 2 actions, resulting in the unexpected dropping of a valuable thing.'

But the association was still something of a stretch. More immediately relevant at the time was how to open the door without bringing my left arm away from my chest. I don't think I had started to think about that yet at that point and I forget how I accomplished it.

I didn't remember which fable it was or the details of the fable. Now, I think it was probably the one about the stork with a fish in its mouth praised for its singing ability, but am still not sure.
