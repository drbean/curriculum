'A reference point .. occurred to many people'

should be

'It occurred to many people that the storming of the Winter Palace was
an analogous event in history.'

'That this historical event also occurred to Tarrio is unexceptional'

should be

'That it also occurred to Tarrio that this was an analogous historical
event is unsurprising.'

Reference points and historical events don't occur to people.

`After all` in the past:

`It looked like rain would prevent play, but it didn't rain *after
all.*`

In the present:

`I'm giving up. *After all*, the grapes are probably sour.`

Fox: I should continue to try, but I'm not going to, because the grapes
are probably sour.

Forced to choose 1 of 2 undesirable alternatives, I choose the more
undesirable +one. The reason is:

The meaning in both cases: Something expected does not happen.

By noting the time relationship between the dangle emails, the lack of
reaction, and the deleting of emails and then going no further, we are
given the opportunity to link the events, but the post hoc propter hoc
logical fallacy is avoided.

I don't see speculation at http://emptywheel.net about the link. I'm
pretty sure the emails were an attempt to get support.

Mastodon posts are like a prophet crying in the wilderness.

Or the professorial voice. The students may or may not be listening. The
prof doesn't know.

Chat is like a conversation. Everyone has a voice and the floor is open.
Domination of the conversation is not appreciated.

But chat builds a wall. Interacting with content is smoother from the
fediverse. The Internet is a reading, not writing, experience.

I regret not taking video of these 2 dogs barking at each other, one
bark in turn. They only did it once or twice.

Momotaro never barked at intruders until the more vocal Yuhi arrived 3

Facing each other:

Y: Yap!

I didn't know why they were barking at each other. I imagine Yuhi wanted

I am a teacher of English and an editor in Taiwan, Japan and Korea and a
learner of Chinese, Japanese and Korean in those countries.

Teaching English to non-native speakers is very interesting. I can
compare and contrast my relationships with my NNS students with my
relationships with the people I an learning from.

These are relationships between relationships which are obvious to
anyone who has taught their language abroad, but don’t figure in applied
linguistics.

https://nativecamp.net/blog/20221215-korian warns Japanese in Korea to
add 'for me' to 'Please X'. In a taxi, 'Please go to A for me,' not
'Please go to A'.

That's odd. Explicitness about power differentials, closeness and who

at all levels of formality.

How did 'please' in Japanese avoid this grammar program?

I'm using mastodon as a [rubber
duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging), a device
(not person) to which you direct ideas, questions or issues which
confuse you and as a result of which process you find you understand
more.

Teaching does this too, says wikipedia.

However, this can be offensive to people in the environment who hear you
and respond, if their advice, sympathy and concern is ignored.

Is that why teachers get a lot of disrespect?

Finding fault with DOJ English, I don't think, "relevant to Intervenor’s

robust over various conditions, that people when asked how something

What would have happened if people were asked how a narrow escape from a

Waking--the road to error

In a waking reverie, pioneering psychologist, William James, thought
with

Higamus, Hogamus
Woman are monogamous
Hogamus, higamus
Men are polygamous

he had discovered a great truth.

But later, in the light of day, reflecting on that opinion, he dismissed
it.

I thought, due to reading a HJ Eysenck popular exposition of pysychology
for a lay audience, that this was an experience of William James.

Mmh.

There may be something in claims that Eysenck's scientific work was
(also) a 'figment of his imagination' or the product of a fevered mind.

His teacher, Cyril Burt is also known as the serial perpetrator of
scientific fraud.

But, is psychology (also) a scientific fraud?

Nothing is necessary, but when you’re hungry, naked and homeless in a
hostile environment, you have PressingNeeds.

If those PressingNeeds are satisfied, the survival of the individual is
insured (at least until the problem of OldAge, SickNess and DeatH is
encountered),

The survival of the human race is not insured, unless the
need/want/desire of men for ejaculation (or is it, penetration) in a
woman is satisfied.

Men (ie me) are confused about the relation of what they're doing with
intimacy.

Speaking for all men, I say we are confused about the relation of
intercourse with intimacy.

We understand sex is impossible without physical entanglement.

We don't understand the emotional entanglement, attachment, bonds that
result from intercourse, and which I believe (but cannot prove) are
baked in to intercourse.

Seeing it as an analogue to the physical tie that locks together
copulating dogs helps me understand.

A: Being a teacher, especially if self-consciousness is a problem to

Montaigne claims consciousness for spiders and ants. Singer and Clarke

While accusing others, he slides by the case of insects, spiders and

of the pot calling the kettle black.’

'A stitch in time saves nine'

is the antithesis of

'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'

'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.'

is the same idea as

'The perfect is the enemy of the good.'

Does this mean

'A stitch in time saves nine'

is also the antithesis of

'The perfect is the enemy of the good'?

You have a problem which you can live with, because it's not a real

Pro-actively, 'A stitch ..' says fix it.

Re-actively, 'If it ain't broke ..' says don't fix it.

Assuming a problem you can live with is a 'good' state of affairs, 'The
perfect ..' agrees you shouldn't fix it, following Murphy's Law,

A conversation could go,

A: I thought you were my friend. Whose side are you on?'
B: Just because you're on my side doesn't mean I'm on your side!

A believer in #POSSE, I am motivated by
https://twocanoes.com/knowledge-base/owning-it/, boosted by molly0xfff,
to write scripts to post to my own site from the command line, making it
as easy to do as posting a mastodon toot from the command line, and to
do it at the same time.

#POSSE (Publish Own Site Syndicate Everywhere) motivated the developer
at https://twocanoes.com/knowledge-base/owning-it/ to cease embedding
their youtube videos on their website and instead embed them from their
storage on the cloud and then also publish them on youtube independently
of their website. I don't think this was #vendor_lockin by youtube, but
the lack of #vendorlockin needs to be considered another of the virtues
of #POSSE

I need to be careful of who I accuse of #vendor_lockin here, but my
failure to export my mastodon toots as plain text, giving up on an
attempt to extract them with jq (a great tool) from the JSON glob
exported by ActivityPub a couple of months ago, contributes to my
support for #POSSE. It doesn't t lessen my appreciation for mastodon and
ActivityPub as vendors/brands of the FOSS software I'm grateful for.

Searching for an explanation of the chemistry of family emotional bonds
that relies on #imprinting events rather than on more general causes
identified with the bonds' effects, we need look no further than
intercourse (even just courtship, perhaps) and childbirth, events which
are powerful enough to flip any number of switches and push any number
of buttons.

But given these emotional relationships between husband and wives, and
mothers and children, how do we explain the bonds between fathers and
children and between siblings? Given father -> mother, and mother ->
child, perhaps the relation is transitive, so we have father ->
children, in the spirit of 'Love me, love my dog.'

POSSE (Publish on Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere) is great. The issue is
control. Not control of other people, but having what I do work or not
work. On my own site, I don't need Big Tech to have a voice. And I
really feel a sense of achievement getting the machine to do what I
want, which contributes to the image I have of myself, my feelings of
self-efficacy, which are not supported in my interactions with people,
because they don't do what I want.

CUSP stands for Control, Uncertainty, Support and Pressure, a recipe for
stress. The framework of some Scottish psychologists, it helps
understand its causes. Lack of Control is whatever you do not working.
Uncertainty is not knowing how things are going to work out from this
point on. Lack of Support is when you don't have anyone to turn to and
the people around you aren't helping. Pressure is the demands made of
you by others or yourself.

DIY (Do It Yourself) is a second initialism after CUSP relevant for
POSSE. Rather than being a consumer of a vendor's work, relying on them
to give you a voice on the Internet, following the DIY philosophy you
become a producer and build the means to do that yourself. Building a
platform gives you a sense of achievement and is satisfying. Open
source/free software gives you the material and the tools to build the
platform, and building it is half the fun of having an Internet
presence.

'Holmes's percentages had been going up before 1880 before Sherlock
Holmes appeared and have been going down since 1900 after his presence

Descartes could have thought of cartesian coordinates in bed in the
morning looking at the ceiling. Perhaps there were geometrical designs
there. At least, the ceiling would have been rectangular. However, the
real story is he wasn't trying to algebraise geometry, apparently, but
rather analyze arbitrary 3-line geometry problems by adding 2 oblique
lines with determinable relations with the original 3 lines, solvable
using ruler and compass. And the rest is history.

'agent' is an autoantonym or contronym, meaning either a doer or actor
with some sort of free will or control over events, or alternatively an
entity controlled by a principal, but with some independence.
https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/agent doesn't recognize any tension
between the meanings.

A Mail User Agent is your email app. A Mail Transfer Agent is what moves
the email between mail servers. In which sense is 'agent' being used?
The first sense, rather than the second, perhaps? Or, both?

I think my choice of high jump development for the vehicle of my attack
on AI may have been prompted by my own need to get a heavy object to a
high position.

Every morning, it requires some physical effort to lift a heavy,
foldable mattress and put it into a waist-level shelf, stack blankets
and quilt on top of that, and stuff a bulky air quilt in the space left
below the top of the closet.

I like to think of the best way to accomplish that.

After the fact, I see parallels with high jumpers thinking of new ways
to lift themselves up into a high position. At the time, I only chose
the high jump because I thought the creative process involved in its
development would be impossible for AI.

I too could have developed the Fosbury Flop!

Reblogging a status on one instance you are on on a different instance
not possible?

> ID numbers aren't shared between servers. you need to use the LOCAL
status IDs,

A workaround:

* Follow the account with the status you want to reblog on the instance
you want it to be reblogged on.
* Reblog the status now appearing in the timeline.
* Unfollow the account. It will disappear from your home timeline but it
appears the ID is still valid.

This may or may not work.

vertical bar inside the zero (0) in Hack versus the horizontal bar in

The Windows cmd terminal has a forward slash in zero (0). PowerShell

I'm going to stay with Hack, because 'rm' looks like an extra-wide glyph
in DejaVu Sans Mono. There's no space between the 'r' and the 'm'. It
looks like a 3-legged elephant with a trunk. It's also hard to
distinguish the eight (8) and zero (0) at small sizes. 2/2

The Mechanical-Turk-like prowess of AI shown recently is not just a
distillation of all the data collected off web pages published in the
last 30 years. It's also the stream of data you have provided the search
services by asking them questions about that published data. That data
of yours is not on the Internet, but just as it bears a relation to what
your search was, it models what you do when you interact with some AI
service. See intelligence in your question, not in the AI response.

Comparative psychologists studying animal cognition appear to have
become wary of endorsing dramatic claims for the ability ofanimals, eg
for parrots https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alex_(parrot), and
philosophical speculation about animal sentience in the case of insects
and other organisms has been questioned. See

animal cognition research:

1. design control conditions with an adversarial attitude
2. establish robustness to variation in stimuli
3. analyze failure types, moving beyond success/failure dichotomy
4. clarify differences between mechanism and behavior
5. meet the organism where it is, while noting systemic limitations 4/?

The 5 principles of 258_Position_Principles_of_Ani.pdf, a paper applying
animal cognition research methodology to AI cognition research. They
are 1. adversarial thinking (the subject is tricky), 2. the simplest
possible explanation (isn't that the Einstein aphorism?), 3. only
results over a range of specific phenomena justifies claims of an
abstract ability, 4. 'functional ability,' when a claim can't be made,
5. meeting the subject where it is, because it can't 'speak the
language.'

I got the 5 principles mixed up. Principle 2, 'Establish robustness to
variation in stimuli' I had as Principle 3. The actual Principle 3 is my
Principle 2, but my statement of it as 'the simplest explanation'
mischaracterizes it. It actually is '3. Analyze failure types, moving

The Weizenbaum wikipedia article,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joseph_Weizenbaum, explains his
ambivalence on AI with his distinction between deciding and choosing, a
distinction I had not recognized. Deciding, being calculating, could be
calculated, but choosing, could not be. Being based on values, ie,
non-rationality, choice, on the basis of tasks and criteria, can only be
creative human acts with consequences. Deciding and choosing, a
distinction without a difference?

sponge(1) is counterintuitive. The man page says, sponge reads standard
input and writes it out to the specified file. Unlike a shell redirect,
sponge soaks up all its input before writing the output file. This
allows constructing pipelines that read from and write to the same file.

But this code,

< file.txt sponge | tac > file.txt

truncates the file. This code,

< file.txt tac | sponge file.txt

works. I don't understand. At the end doesn't seem like the right place
for it.

Living breathing doll" is a song title, a later rendering of the
earlier song title, "Living doll". ddg returns "breathing doll" doll

Living breathing doll" is a figurative phrase or idiom that describes a
person who is exceptionally beautiful, charming, or endearing, often to
the point of seeming unreal or like a perfectly crafted doll come to
life. It can also refer to the "Living Doll" aesthetic, a beauty trend
characterized by a hyper-feminine, doll-like appearance, and in a
broader sense, can refer to life-sized, lifelike mannequins or dolls,
such as the historical Japan iki-ningyo.

There's much wrong with this changing AI Assist. The 2 sentences are 2
bites at the apple, failing because they are saying essentially the same
thing twice. The verbs in the 2 sentences, "describe", "seem", "refer,"
possess", "be", "have", "seem", "come to life", "refer" again,
characterize" are weak verbs. Without meaningful verbs, the effect is
of having a series of noun phrases hanging together grammatically, but
failing to communicate semantically anything more than they would as a

How did I do? The phrase, in a broader sense is used to indicate some
form of hypernym/hyponym relationship and synecdoche (?), I think. It is
not used to introduce a different thing which is also an exemplar of the
category being discussed. There are probably animal and plant terms used
this way, Eg, “cats”, “big cats” and, in a broader sense, “the cat

wrote about ways of referring to future action in English:

will" is used to make a public commitment,
like when making a decision and telling someone about
it, ie a Rubicon moment.

A: Don't you think you should use public transport?
B: I will use it next week.

going to" is different.

A: Don't you think you should use public transport?
B: I'm going to use it next week (but I disagree it's
important to use it.) 1/2

Present continuous with future reference is used to
show a planning and action mindset.

A: Don't you think you should use public transport?
B: I'm using it next week (I already use it and/or I agree it's
important to use public transport).

On the other hand, "want" is a wishy-washy way of
showing intention.

A: Don't you think you should use public transport?
B: I want to (but won't/cannot).

interactive, and non-interactive shell. Non-interactive shells are not
connected to stdin or stdout, whereas interactive shells are, but with
limited functionality, eg /etc/profile is not read. Login shells get all
the functionality bash can provide. Non-interactive shells are for
scripts, interactive shells are for sub-shells and login shells are not
sub-shells, but the shell you want when you login. The name’s just
confusing.

The explanation at
https://www.electoral-vote.com/evp2025/Items/Nov18-1.html of the idiom,
“Can’t see the forest for the trees,” is that in a forest, you only see
individual trees, not the whole forest from an aerial view. I think it
stems from a conversation with someone who doesn’t understand forests.:
See that forest over there?: I only see trees. It’s behind the trees?:
Oh, you can’t see the forest for the trees?idiom captures a problematic
failure to understand a problem.

It’s used when the means to understand the problem lie under your nose,
but you fail to put 2 & 2 together. Googling shows more literal
interpretations, ‘trapped by details,’ ‘too involved in a situation,’
‘deep in granular details, failing to get the big picture.’ Perhaps
they’re better. But the idea is that you have a grasp of a problem, but
it is a problematic grasp? That you have a framing problem?

I think I was wrong about the woods/trees idiom being about not
accepting what’s staring you in the face, under your nose, & not putting
2+2 together, but perhaps it is about framing the problem, or getting
the wrong end of the stick. It’s certainly about recognizing you have a
grasp of some aspects (details) of the problem, but not the most
important ones (the big picture). What role does the idiom have in a
conversation?

I think the forest/tree idiom is used to say, “Your view’s plausible,
partly right, even, but wrong,” with the same force as Korzybski’s “the
map is not the territory,” and Mencken’s “every complex problem has a
solution that is clear, simple and wrong,”and Shakespeare’s “there are

There’s no mind behind LLM translations from Chinese to English, so
although they do a fantastic job at sentence-level syntax translation,
they’re lost with unspoken articles and tense distinctions conveyed from
mind to mind in Chinese because the Chinese text gives them no guidance
as to how to express them in text in English where they are a
grammatical requirement. They can read text, but can’t read minds.
That’s my story, anyway, and I’m sticking with it. #LLM #中文

This AI-LLM hair on fire moment is shaping up to be a battle polarized
into those for those against. I'm in the against camp, because the LLM
result in CJK profs not asking me to edit their papers
https://quoteinvestigator.com/2017/11/30/salary/. But Mark Dominus and
Terence Tao, whom I respect and admire are for, which is a problem.

I also don't like to be categorized, so I'm going to join the 'run with

Tobacco addiction goes beyond those physiological mechanisms of taste
however by inducing a new substance need paralleling the need for food.
This new substance need governed by the taste/smell of tobacco is
biologically unsound. But can we still learn something about the role of
good/bad tastes in making biologically-sound eating decisions?\\n

What about raw meat? Eating it is, let's say, biologically-sound,
because eating cooked meat is, it being nutritional. The Japanese eat
raw fish, but is there any group where raw meat eating is a practice?
(Apparently Inuit do) It doesn't taste good, but cooked meat does.

I want to find points in the evolution of Homo sapiens where cooking
with fire and meat eating became common practices. If I can show some
relationship, perhaps I can establish meat-eating became a practice
after it started tasting good, because it was cooked.

Or perhaps, meat tastes evolved.

This runs up against food aversions which result in eating decisions
with no nutritional benefit. And the eating of fermented foods despite
\\“bad\\” tastes.

For "biologically-sound", or "beneficial", read "nutritious and with
reduced risk of harm to health". With this definition, eating of raw
animal products (including milk and eggs?) is not biologically-sound,
because of the risk of parasites. The unappealing taste of raw meat (and
to a lesser extent of raw fish, but not animal milk?), and all
non-fresh, non-cooked thing which looks it might still be swallowable,
is a word to the wise, "Don't eat it\\!"\\n
