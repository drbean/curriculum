% Matching card faces

Flash cards aren't just for learning 
vocabulary by self study, in which case 
computerized systems like 
[Anki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki) 
implementing spaced repetition 
algorithms are a better alternative.

Their value is in how they are able to 
transform a cerebral matching exercise 
into something approaching a card game.
