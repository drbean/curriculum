On date, maxdamantus changed the wikipedia
[Death Row](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Row)
entry from 
the number on death row as of date was number.

He said his reason for changing it was the number is not a running total.

I might not have changed it, but I can see his point. The number goes up and down. There is not a true value for the number, the number today, for example. The number for date is not a stand-in for the number at some other time.

Unless you're arguing there is some trend or development in the number. For example, the Supreme Court of the US rules the death penalty is constitutional. What effect does this have on the number over time? Supposing we're arguing the courts impose the death penalty less often, we want to know if the number on death row is in fact decreasing. We don't have today/this week/this hour's figures, but we do have last month's. We can say 

the number on death row as of date was number.

We don't have the right number, but we have a number which is good enough, recorded on some other occasion when it was the right number.

But note the tense of the verb.

As of last week, the number on death row is X
