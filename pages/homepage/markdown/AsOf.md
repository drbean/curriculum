% As of last week/next week

In 2013, maxdamantus changed the wikipedia
[Death Row](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_Row)
entry from 

There were approximately 3,146 people on death row in the United States *as of* October 1, 2012.

to

There were approximately 3,125 people on death row in the United States *on* January 1, 2013.

He said his reason for changing it was the number is not a running total. "'as of' makes it sound like it's counting all, historically"

I might not have changed it, but I can see his point. It's not the total number of people who have ever been on death row. The number goes up and down. There is not a true value for the number. The number today, for example, is not the correct value, any more than the number last week. The number for date is not a stand-in for the number at some other time.

Unless you're arguing there is some trend or development in the number. For example, the Supreme Court of the US rules the death penalty is not 'cruel and unusual punishment' and thus not unconstitutional. What effect does this have on the number over time? Supposing we're arguing the courts impose the death penalty less often as a result, knowing that their death sentences are not just empty threats but are going to be carried out. We want to check if the number on death row is in fact decreasing. We don't have today/this week/this hour's figures, but we do have the number before the ruling and the number last month. We can say 

The number on death row as of last month is 3,125, 
which is an increase/decrease from the 3,146 
before the ruling.

We don't have the right number, but we have a number which is good enough, recorded on some other occasion when it was the right number.

What are some rulings that SCOTUS has made on capital punishment? The wikipedia page on 
[capital punishment in the US](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/capital_punishment_in_the_US)
has analysis of the effect of SCOTUS decisions and eight instances of 'as of'.  

Or more precisely, there were eight "as of"'s in the article on September 17, 2021. But not, there are/were eight "as of"'s in the article as of September 17, 2021. Unless we have a plan to eliminate some of these "as of"'s.

But note the tense of the verb.

As of last week, there are X people on death row.
