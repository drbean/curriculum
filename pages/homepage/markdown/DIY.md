% Building a platform to speak on the Internet from

DIY (Do It Yourself) is a second initialism after CUSP relevant for POSSE. Rather than being a consumer of a vendor's work, relying on them to give you a voice on the Internet, following the DIY philosophy you become a producer and build the means to do that yourself. Building a platform gives you a sense of achievement and is satisfying. Open source/free software gives you the material and the tools to build the platform, and building it is half the fun of having an Internet presence.
