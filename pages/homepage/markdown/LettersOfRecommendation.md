%  Letters I wrote for students and other teachers wrote for me

## Letters for myself

I mostly ghostwrote these letters. That is, I wrote them and they signed them. However, I think it was a valuable lesson for me, and if a student asks me to write a letter of recommendation I try to turn it into a valuable exercise for them, too. See below.
