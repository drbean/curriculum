| iversity.                         |                                   |

|                                   |                                   |
| Chinmin Institute of Technology   |                                   |
| is closing down its AFL           |                                   |
| Department, and I am now looking  |                                   |
| for another job, so I wish to     |                                   |
| apply for the contract-based      |                                   |
| positions teaching English at     |                                   |
| your university. I think I would  |                                   |
| be an asset to your school.       |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| For the seven years I have been   |                                   |
| in Taiwan at Chinmin, I have been |                                   |
| working with lower-level,         |                                   |
| unmotivated students. With these  |                                   |
| students, I had to rework the way |                                   |
| I teach. I had to move away from  |                                   |
| pairwork and groupwork to work    |                                   |
| with the whole class, because the |                                   |
| students were generally unwilling |                                   |
| to use English unless the teacher |                                   |
| was observing them.               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Instead, for homework I had them  |                                   |
| work in pairs doing simple        |                                   |
| dictation exercises that I hoped  |                                   |
| they might be willing to do in    |                                   |
| English. I attempted to prevent   |                                   |
| the collusion that I thought was  |                                   |
| more likely in this homework by   |                                   |
| making the partners adversaries.  |                                   |
| Whether I was successful in       |                                   |
| preventing collusion is           |                                   |
| debatable, but overall I think I  |                                   |
| did an excellent job of creating  |                                   |
| favorable attitudes to English    |                                   |
| and to schoolwork among these     |                                   |
| students, at the same time as I   |                                   |
| significantly raised their levels |                                   |
| of achievement. I certainly seem  |                                   |
| to have gained their respect.     |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| My success was partly the result  |                                   |
| of my technique, the result of    |                                   |
| the activities I devised to get   |                                   |
| them to do to use English to      |                                   |
| learn the language, and partly    |                                   |
| the result of the personal warmth |                                   |
| I felt and showed to them as my   |                                   |
| students, the result of who I am  |                                   |
| as a person. No doubt the latter  |                                   |
| is more important than the        |                                   |
| former. I place more importance   |                                   |
| on the technique however. I wish  |                                   |
| to continue developing that       |                                   |
| technique.                        |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Now, I am ready to apply the      |                                   |
| lessons I have learned here to    |                                   |
| the practice I developed before   |                                   |
| in Korea where I also taught      |                                   |
| university students. I believe I  |                                   |
| am well suited to teaching at the |                                   |
| university level. Even though my  |                                   |
| master\'s is not in TESOL, my     |                                   |
| native intelligence, my           |                                   |
| background in psychology and my   |                                   |
| extensive reading in TESOL and    |                                   |
| applied linguistics fit me for an |                                   |
| academic position.                |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I am more interested in the       |                                   |
| practice, that is, in teaching    |                                   |
| itself, than in the theory, that  |                                   |
| is, in knowledge about learning   |                                   |
| and language, but I also          |                                   |
| recognize, as Kurt Lewin noted,   |                                   |
| that there is nothing as          |                                   |
| practical as a good theory. I     |                                   |
| hope that your department is also |                                   |
| interested in such a              |                                   |
| collaboration between theory and  |                                   |
| practice. If it is, I look        |                                   |
| forward to working with you at    |                                   |
