| Dear Sir/Madam,                   |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Chinmin Institute of Technology   |                                   |
| is closing down its AFL           |                                   |
| Department, and I am now looking  |                                   |
| for another job, so I wish to     |                                   |
| apply for a position at your      |                                   |
| school. I think I would be an     |                                   |
| asset to your English department. |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| For the seven years I have been   |                                   |
| in Taiwan at Chinmin, I have been |                                   |
| working with lower-level,         |                                   |
| unmotivated students. For these   |                                   |
| students, I developed a number of |                                   |
| innovative teaching activities,   |                                   |
| for example, pair dictation,      |                                   |
| where partners read a dialog, but |                                   |
| at the same time write it down.   |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Whether I was successful in a lot |                                   |
| of my work at Chinmin is          |                                   |
| debatable, but overall I think I  |                                   |
| did an excellent job of creating  |                                   |
| favorable attitudes to English    |                                   |
| and to school work among these    |                                   |
| students. I certainly seem to     |                                   |
| have gained their respect.        |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| The problems of my students, and  |                                   |
| Taiwanese learners of English in  |                                   |
| general, are a lack of            |                                   |
| confidence, stress and other      |                                   |
| forms of discomfort, and a lack   |                                   |
| of adventurousness. These are the |                                   |
| result of unenjoyable experiences |                                   |
| in school learning English, the   |                                   |
| lack of contact with users of the |                                   |
| language, and their experiments   |                                   |
| with using the language being     |                                   |
| disappointing.                    |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| With the next step in my career,  |                                   |
| I want to have an effect on this  |                                   |
| situation, by developing my       |                                   |
| teaching repertoire and helping   |                                   |
| students grow as learners of      |                                   |
| English. I am confident the       |                                   |
| future is bright. If your school  |                                   |
| is also of such a view, I would   |                                   |
| enjoy working with you,           |                                   |
| developing confident, relaxed,    |                                   |
| adventurous and superior speakers |                                   |
| of the English language.          |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
