https://www.emptywheel.net/2022/12/07/another-late-september-russian-influence-peddler-indictment/ reports prosecutors saying:

'The conduct of this Kremlin asset .. has shown he is ready, willing, and capable of exploiting ..'

should be

'The conduct of this Kremlin asset .. has shown he is not just ready, willing, and able, but also capable of exploiting ..'

The blend of the RWA idiom destroys its connotation.

Or:

'[His] conduct .. has shown [him] capable of and intent on exploiting ..'
