% 'Ready, Willing and Capable' should be 'Ready, Willing and Able'

reports prosecutors saying:

`The conduct of this Kremlin asset, who was sanctioned for trying to poison our democracy, has shown he is ready, willing, and capable of exploiting our banking system ..`

I think they should have said:

`The conduct of this Kremlin asset .. has shown he is not just ready, willing, and able, but also quite capable of exploiting our banking system ..`

`Ready, willing and able` is an idiom, meaning eager to do something.

`Able` and `capable` are quite similar in meaning, but the blend destroys the positive connotation the idiom enjoys.

They could have also said:

`The conduct of this Kremlin asset .. has shown he is capable of and intent on exploiting our banking system ..`
