POSSE (Publish on Own Site, Syndicate Everywhere) is great. The issue is control. Not control of other people, but having what I do work or not work. On my own site, I don't need Big Tech to have a voice. And I really feel a sense of achievement getting the machine to do what I want, which contributes to the image I have of myself, my feelings of self-efficacy, which are not supported in my interactions with people, because they don't do what I want.
