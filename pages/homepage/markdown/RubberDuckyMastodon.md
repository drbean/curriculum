I'm using mastodon as a
[rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging),
a device (not person) to which you direct ideas, questions or issues which confuse you and as a result of which process you find you understand more.

Teaching does this too, says wikipedia.

However, this can be offensive to people in the environment who hear you and respond, if their advice, sympathy and concern is ignored.

Is that why teachers get a lot of disrespect?
