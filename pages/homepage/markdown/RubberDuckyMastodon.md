% Just thinking out aloud here

I think I'm using mastodon as a kind of 
[rubber ducky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging),
a device/object (rather than person) to which one directs inchoate expressions of ideas, questions or issues in the process of which the ideas, questions and issues become better conceptualized and answers become clear.

The process of writing/speaking results in the feeling that questions have been answered despite the absence of any source for the answers.

Also, teaching does thia, according to the wikipedia article.

However, such activity can be offensive to people in the environment who hear the speaker and respond to their questions, only to have their advice, sympathy and concern being ignored.

Is that why teachers get a lot of disrespect?
