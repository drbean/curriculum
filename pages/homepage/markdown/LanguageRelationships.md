% Category theory for English teachers

I am a teacher of English and an editor in Taiwan, Japan and Korea and a learner of Chinese, Japanese and Korean in those countries.

Teaching English to non-native speakers is very interesting. I can compare and contrast my relationships with my NNS students with my relationships with the people *I* an learning from.

These are relationships between relationships which are obvious to anyone who has taught their language abroad, but don't figure in applied linguistics.

Category theory, anyone?
