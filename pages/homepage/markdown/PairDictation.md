| My work with dictation started    |                                   |
| with paired crossword-filling     |                                   |
| activities, in either groups of   |                                   |
| four or two. I used various       |                                   |
| crossword creating programs with  |                                   |
| the text and vocabulary from the  |                                   |
| lesson as clues and crossword     |                                   |
| entries.                          |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |

| Carried out as homework, the      |                                   |
| student pairs were supervised by  |                                   |
| an MC and a guard, other students |                                   |
| who were not doing the dictation, |                                   |
| but were getting a grade for      |                                   |
| their supervision of the          |                                   |
| crossword-filling students. The   |                                   |
| students doing the crossword were |                                   |
| challenged by a time limit, or    |                                   |
| competition with another pair.    |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Before working with crosswords, I |                                   |
| was doing picture dictations in   |                                   |
| pairs.                            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| For the last 2 years, in Freshman |                                   |
| English classes outside the       |                                   |
| department and in                 |                                   |
| listening/conversation classes in |                                   |
| the AFL Department with           |                                   |
| lower-level unmotivated learners, |                                   |
| I have been doing pair dictations |                                   |
| of conversation texts, as an exam |                                   |
| activity. Student A reads one     |                                   |
| half of a text, a dialog between  |                                   |
| 2 people, to their partner B, who |                                   |
| writes it down. Then B reads to   |                                   |
| A. It is surprisingly             |                                   |
| challenging, because I don\'t     |                                   |
| allow any Chinese.                |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I also use dictation in class,    |                                   |
| with one or two students          |                                   |
| dictating to the rest of the      |                                   |
| class.                            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Dictation can be boring, but with |                                   |
| the computer-generated materials  |                                   |
| I have developed where students   |                                   |
| have to fill in letters, rather   |                                   |
| than words, the students          |                                   |
| generally find it interesting.    |                                   |
| This is because there are limited |                                   |
| choices and feedback is precise   |                                   |
| and generally quick. This is      |                                   |
| motivating.                       |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Class dictations where 1 or 2     |                                   |
| students read the passage and the |                                   |
| rest of the class, tries to fill  |                                   |
| in the letters is, surprisingly   |                                   |
| quite interesting to my           |                                   |
| lower-level students at the       |                                   |
| moment.                           |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I wouldn\'t use dictation as much |                                   |
| with higher-level students. With  |                                   |
| them, communication, or use of    |                                   |
| language for non-language ends,   |                                   |
| in other words, listening and     |                                   |
| speaking AND thinking, must be an |                                   |
| objective. With lower-level       |                                   |
| students, they may resist more    |                                   |
| than encoding (into speech) and   |                                   |
| decoding (into a representation   |                                   |
| of speech), the psychological     |                                   |
| processes involved in dictation.  |                                   |
