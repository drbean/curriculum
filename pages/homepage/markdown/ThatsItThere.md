% "That's it there!" versus "There it is!"

What's the difference between "That's it there!" and "There it is!" in terms of topic?

"There it is!"

:    Looking for scissors:

    	There they are!

     On finding them. The topic is the scissors, or the present activity is looking for the scissors.

"That's it there!"

:    The scissors were on the mind previously, but now something else is happening.

    	That's them there!

    Something is seen whose relevance is not immediately apparent. Then it is realized that what is seen is something that was previously on the mind. The scissors is not the topic, but it^[On plural subjects, singular verbs see [SubjectVerbDisagreement](SubjectVerbDisagreement.html)] previously was the topic.

What about a posse pursuing some bandits through open country on horses. The outlaws are some distance ahead of the posse and the posse occasionally loses sight of them, which is not good. They see them:

	There they are!

or

	That's them there!

I can't see a reason to choose one or the other.
