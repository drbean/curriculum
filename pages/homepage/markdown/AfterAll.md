`After all` apparently has 2 different uses [^1]: the first with reference to past events, and the second with reference to non-past events.

In the first:

`It looked like rain would prevent play, but it didn't rain *after all.*`

In an alternative universe where the match also went ahead but it *did* rain:

`It looked like rain would prevent play, but the match went ahead *anyway.*`

In the second:

[The fox and the grapes:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Grapes)

`I'm going to give up. *After all*, the grapes are probably sour.`

I should continue to try to reach the grapes, but, despite that fact and against my best interests, I'm *NOT* going to continue, because ... the grapes are probably sour.

`He hurt me, but I still love him. *After all*, he's my dad.`

I should break off with my dad because of the way he treated me, but, despite that fact and against my best interests, I'm *NOT* going to do that, because ... he's my dad.

Faced with a dilemma and forced to choose one of 2 undesirable alternatives, I choose the more undesirable one. Why would I do that? The reason is ...

You can add `anyway` after both sentences in this second case without changing the meaning.

and in the second it is a
[conjunct](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjunct).

An instance from
[a liberal law prof](https://balkin.blogspot.com/2022/12/comments-on-levinsonfest-voting-rights.html)

Law students are treated to theory in law school, but they are destined to be dealing with practice after leaving law school.

`The practical question, perhaps, is the extent to which law students, who aspire, *after all*, to being practicing lawyers and who therefore must take courts and judges with special seriousness, should be taught _only_ the "law" as enunciated by the courts.`
