In English, subjects and verbs are 
supposed to agree in number.

This is called 
[subect-verb agreement](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/subect-verb_agreement)

But not objects?

	Subject-verb agreement and definite/indefinite
	articles are A BIG PROBLEM for learners of English.

Could be 'big problems'.

But this ability to do it both ways is 
also seen to a limited extent with some 
subjects.

	One and one are two.
	One and two are/is (?) three.

When a subject is grammatically plural, 
but notionally one thing, the verb may 
be singular.

	This bed-and-breakfast (ie, a 
	kind of lodging) is the best in 
	town.

	If you're down and out, a bed 
	and breakfast are available at 
	the local refuge.

	LA Lakers is/are still the best 
	team?

	Among hat and shoes and shirt 
	and socks, shoes and socks 
	is/are the only pair.

	The only pair are/is shoes and 
	socks.

'Shoes and socks is the only pair' can 
be interpreted as 'The pair [which is 
shoes and socks] is the only pair'.

I actually wrote without forethought:

	B and b is the only pair, leaving A and 
	d.

in [SlowFeedCards](SlowFeedCards.html).

This flexibility matches that with 'there 
is/there are' constructions.

	There are/'s (informal) some 
	people at the door.
