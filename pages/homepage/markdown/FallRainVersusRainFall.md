% Making a distinction where a distinction doesn't exist

Can you discern a difference in meaning between

	It's stopped raining.

and

	The rain has stopped.

I couldn't.

In Chinese apparently, there is such a 
distinction depending on the order of 
the 2 words, 雨, 'rain' and 下, 'down.'

	*Falling rain* means
	*It's raining*

and 

	*Rain falling* can mean
	*The drought has broken*

How can we leverage this to find a 
difference in meaning in the 2 different 
ways to describe rain stopping, and as a 
further objective, help people 
whose native languages don't have 
in/definite articles learn how to use 
'a' and 'the'?

Imagine a telephone conversation between 
someone at school where it has just 
stopped raining, so they're going to go 
home and someone at home, where it has 
not been raining, and it has 
not appeared likely to rain.

	A: It's stopped raining. I'm coming home.
	B: It's raining there?

versus

	A: The rain has stopped. I'm coming home.
	B: What rain? It's not raining here.

Switching around B's response produces 
an anomalous conversation.

	A: It's stopped raining. I'm coming home.
	B: What rain? It's not raining here.

	A: Well, it is, or WAS, raining here.

versus

	A: The rain has stopped. I'm coming home.
	B: It's raining there?

	A: Yeh. It was. It didn't rain there?

The first switch seems more anomalous 
than the second. Or does it?

Putting 'the rain' in the topic position 
at the start of the sentence, like in 
Chinese, shows the speaker assumes the 
rain is shared knowledge. When the 
listener says 'what rain?', the speaker 
should understand their assumption is 
not shared.

There are restrictions on nouns without 
definite articles taking the topic 
position.

Rather than

	Rain is going to fall.

	It's going to rain.

But, 
[A hard rain's gonna fall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Hard_Rain%27s_a-Gonna_Fall)

	A hard rain's gonna fall

Not perhaps today or tomorrow, but you'll shiver in your boots when it does.

	It's going to rain hard.

So, you'd better wear your boots.

And
[A horse walks into a police station](https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/29553477)
But see in the body of the story, "the 
horse that walked into the police 
station."
