Wasn't able to think of any feedback activity, discussion of language, class survey or song, so used book more.

# 3C May 17 written May 22

I recorded from start of hour until end of side 1. I didn't notice when tape ended & I forgot to turn over at the start of second hour. Was not very organized. Stuck up gradesheet. Started recorder. Got exercise books handed out. Collected tapes. It seemed to take so long. Many people had done them, which was rewarding. People were not being very cooperative handing them in. Perhaps I could have let them hand thenm in after, because I could still have seen who did them [who was doing them] in class (by the noise on the tape) & given them a low score. Perhaps I was just filling in time, because listening to tape, I didn't have any activity for long time.

I wrote up 4 points about:

1. name on tape
2. name on cassette box
3. no loose stickers in case
4. rewind tape to start of week's dialogue

I think I played 2 pairs' tapes, but whose? ~~Listening to tape, I didn't have any activity going for a long time.~~ ~~We then~~ ~~We then did~~ John & Stacy and Danice & Money.

Actually this came after quiz.

Quiz on Whose book is this, I did with 3D last week, but not 3C. 1 piece of paper for each group, like 3D, but not my improvised test, rather one in book.

The good news & bad news. I read good news & bad news dialogues with them, talked about congratulating: That's great, Congratulations. And showing sympathy: That's too bad, I'm sorry to hear that. I talked about, The good news is:, The bad news is:, gave examples & told them this would be homework. Actually this came at start of good news/bad news sections. End of first hour.

I think I probably got them to do the substitution drills with participation points written on board & pointing to "Good news"/"Bad news" for drill examples. I couldn't get them to point, so I made them all stand up & when they pointed to right answer they could sit down.

Somewhere in this section, I tried to get them to give good/bad news but I couldn't. Tammy had a cut on head so talked about this. Then I got them to do an exercise in book. Looking at textbook can confirm if this is correct. I probably gave participation points for this too. Adding them to first set. ~~See~~ Yes. See account later in this journal for 3D. I remember trying to start strip dialogue, 1 line per student, but there was not enough time to get the student[s] to do it, so I just let them talk ?

# 3D May 18 written May 22

A 00:23 - 00:50 Side B 01:05 - 01:26

I recorded from start of first hour until end of side A & then turned over but didn't press Record [only Play] so first 9 minutes of B are blank. Recorded second hour until end.

I ~~seemed to go~~ did the same: put up the gradesheet, got exercise books handed out, started recorder. Did something before collecting tapes. Probably played Renee & Angela's and (Rita & Jane's) right away.

Didn't have to do exercise on Whose sock is thiscase. That's right. I told them how they all got right answers for the questions which I hadn't made mistakes with. I remember listening to this on the tape. But didn't I do this first thing.

I generally did the same with Good News, Bad News, but perhaps I changed the order of the examples ~~around~~ & working on the substitution drills, etc around. I remember feeling I was ahead of where I was with 3C. This would have been because of not doing the quiz I did a week before with 3D.

I can remember doing Tim Newfield's point at the Good News & Bad News. I couldn't get anyone to tell me any good news. I spent time talking to Candy who was eating.

Did I do exercise from book. I can't remember? That's right. It was listening exercises from book. I wrote 3 steps on board. 

1. Leader reads from tapescript at back [of book]
2. Others answer a) or b)
3. Leader says whether correct or not.

I named leaders (students with highest grades,) & gave participation points. Then I did listening test based on same patterns using same answers. I took ~~books~~ papers away from students who didn't have books, but gave some back when they produced books. Tried to prevent cheating by getting one student from each group to hand out papers and get them back.

Then finally did strip dialogue giving extra line to 10th, 11th, 12th students. Worked best with area 1, but gave extra students in area 1, 2, 3 these lines. And assigned all students in these areas [illegible] line from book. First area's first 8 students were able to read in right order. This is success of using Line Out technique of Jim Wingate's Getting Students Talking in English. Give each student a responsibility that others will find it difficult to take from their shoulders.

# PS Week 13

I stopped writing these journals when I started preparing reports for class before lessons. I still have the tapings (but perhaps not my memories) [These tapes no longer exist]
