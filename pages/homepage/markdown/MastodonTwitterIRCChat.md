Mastodon posts are like a prophet crying in the wilderness.

Or the professorial voice. The students may or may not be listening. The prof doesn't know.

Chat is like a conversation. Everyone has a voice and the floor is open. Domination of the conversation is not appreciated.

But chat builds a wall. Interacting with content is smoother from the fediverse. The Internet is a reading, not writing, experience.
