% In one corner: Mastodon & Twitter. In the other: chat

Mastodon is competing with Twitter, but it's also competing with IRC and chat to capture interaction with other people.

It is like a prophet crying in the wilderness, gathering followers (who believe in them (or crucify them.))

Or like the professorial voice. (The students may or may not be listening. The prof doesn't know.) The floor is from the start not level.

Chat is more like a conversation. Everyone has a voice and the floor is open. Domination of the conversation by bores who go on and on is not appreciated.

But chat builds a wall between it and the rest of the Internet. Interacting with other content is smoother from the fediverse. Which just goes to show the Internet is a reading, rather than writing, experience.
