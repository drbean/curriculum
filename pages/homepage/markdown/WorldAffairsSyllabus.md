| I have never taught an            |                                   |
| International Affairs class.      |                                   |
| However, I have taught a Media    |                                   |
| class, where we looked at         |                                   |
| political topics in the UK and    |                                   |
| the US like newspaper             |                                   |
| phone-tapping and Obama\'s        |                                   |
| presidential eligibility. In my   |                                   |
| Conversation class I have also    |                                   |
| done units on the 9-11 Attacks.   |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| In the class, it would not be my  |                                   |
| intention to try to teach         |                                   |
| International Relations theory,   |                                   |
| and I would certainly not make it |                                   |
| a platform to present my views on |                                   |
| world affairs. I would create     |                                   |
| teaching units on interesting     |                                   |
| world personalities and events in |                                   |
| the past 20-30 years, and through |                                   |
| contact with the language used in |                                   |
| the listening material and        |                                   |
| discussion, expect the students   |                                   |
| to gain some understanding of the |                                   |
| vocabulary and the ideas that are |                                   |
| important for the understanding   |                                   |
| of international relations.       |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| With the listening material,      |                                   |
| coming from VOA, BBC, CNN and     |                                   |
| Youtube broadcasts, I would       |                                   |
| create dictation exercises, as I  |                                   |
| do for all my Conversation and    |                                   |
| Business English classes, and     |                                   |
| expect the students to do these   |                                   |
| as Internet homework, filling in  |                                   |
| the blanks, before or after       |                                   |
| class,                            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| In class, I would follow a        |                                   |
| Cooperative Learning approach.    |                                   |
| Specifically, we would do Jigsaw  |                                   |
| activities, where each member of  |                                   |
| a 3- or 4-member group is         |                                   |
| presented with different          |                                   |
| information and the group has to  |                                   |
| discuss the information, asking   |                                   |
| each other questions to get the   |                                   |
| \"big picture,\" and also to      |                                   |
| ensure that everyone else also    |                                   |
| understands. (In the 4 exams,     |                                   |
| after discussing their            |                                   |
| information, students have to     |                                   |
| answer questions individually     |                                   |
| about the story, but their grade  |                                   |
| is a group grade.)                |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| For example, a story linking      |                                   |
| Beverly Eckert, a 9-11 advocate   |                                   |
| and Mohammed Atta, a 9-11         |                                   |
| hijacker,                         |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| -   A: You were working at the    |                                   |
|     top of the World Trade Center |                                   |
|     when Mohamed flew his plane   |                                   |
|     into it. You called your wife |                                   |
|     on your cell phone as the     |                                   |
|     building collapsed and told   |                                   |
|     her you loved her.            |                                   |
| -   B: You were the pilot of the  |                                   |
|     aircraft on which Beverly     |                                   |
|     died. The wings stopped       |                                   |
|     lifting the aircraft as it    |                                   |
|     neared the ground, but        |                                   |
|     instead of pointing the plane |                                   |
|     down further to gain speed,   |                                   |
|     you tried to point the plane  |                                   |
|     up.                           |                                   |
| -   C: After your husband, Sean   |                                   |
|     died, you devoted your life   |                                   |
|     to promoting the goals of the |                                   |
|     families of the people who    |                                   |
|     died in the 9-11 attacks. You |                                   |
|     wanted the U.S. government to |                                   |
|     do more. But you died in the  |                                   |
|     plane piloted by Marvin.      |                                   |
| -   D: You attacked the World     |                                   |
|     Trade Center, because you     |                                   |
|     hated the U.S. You didn\'t    |                                   |
|     know Beverly and her husband, |                                   |
|     but you thought their deaths  |                                   |
|     were justified. Anyway, you   |                                   |
|     and all of the others are     |                                   |
|     dead now.                     |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| As debriefing of this information |                                   |
| gap activity, we draw a diagram   |                                   |
| on the board, identifying         |                                   |
| Personalities, Relationships,     |                                   |
| Feelings and the Story.           |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Then the groups are asked to      |                                   |
| write WH-questions, YN-questions  |                                   |
| and tag questions about the 911   |                                   |
| Attacks on the board.             |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| My NUU students (and Taiwanese    |                                   |
| students in general?) are not     |                                   |
| active participants in class.     |                                   |
| They do not question me, or       |                                   |
| express their opinions. But I     |                                   |
| hope that students in the World   |                                   |
| Affairs class would be more       |                                   |
| willing to interact with me,      |                                   |
| either as a whole class, or in    |                                   |
| groups, to ask me questions about |                                   |
| my views and to present their     |                                   |
| views. If they were prepared to   |                                   |
| do that, I would then provide a   |                                   |
| soundfile and information about   |                                   |
| 9-11 Truthers (conspiracy         |                                   |
| theorists) and ask them to talk   |                                   |
| about it in the last part of this |                                   |
| 9-11 unit in class.               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Classwork (participation and the  |                                   |
| number of questions written on    |                                   |
| the board) would be a group grade |                                   |
| worth 20 percent of the grade.    |                                   |
| Membership of groups would be     |                                   |
| reshuffled every 4 weeks.         |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| After this class, for homework,   |                                   |
| students write questions and      |                                   |
| answers about the story using an  |                                   |
| Internet question-answering       |                                   |
| application I have developed.     |                                   |
| Ungrammatical questions are not   |                                   |
| recognized, so this is also a     |                                   |
| grammar exercise. This (with the  |                                   |
| dictation exercises in alternate  |                                   |
| weeks) would be 40 percent of the |                                   |
| grade.                            |                                   |

| Every 4 weeks, I would do an exam |                                   |
| in 2 parts. In the first part,    |                                   |
| students would do similar Jigsaw  |                                   |
| exercises to the ones they had    |                                   |
| already done in previous weeks,   |                                   |
| but would also answer 10          |                                   |
| questions about the story. This   |                                   |
| exam would be conducted by a      |                                   |
| student group. In the other part, |                                   |
| that I conduct, students are      |                                   |
| paired and ask each other         |                                   |
| questions about the stories of    |                                   |
| the previous 4 weeks, and I award |                                   |
| points on the basis of the        |                                   |
| grammaticality of the questions   |                                   |
| and the correctness of the        |                                   |
| answers. One of the pair is the   |                                   |
| winner getting 3 points and the   |                                   |
| other is the loser, getting 2.    |                                   |
| These 4 exams would be also 40    |                                   |
| percent of the grade.             |                                   |

| I might do these in the first 4   |                                   |
