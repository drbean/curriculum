| In a real jigsaw, a picture on a  |                                   |
| board is cut up into little       |                                   |
| interlocking blocks. The puzzle   |                                   |
| is, given the individual blocks,  |                                   |
| to put them together so the       |                                   |
| picture is reconstituted.         |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| In the jigsaw activity in         |                                   |
| [CooperativeLearning](Cooperative |                                   |
| Learning.html),                   |                                   |
| members of a group are each given |                                   |
| different information, that       |                                   |
| individually leaves the members   |                                   |
| puzzled, because, for instance,   |                                   |
| it is only about one aspect of a  |                                   |
| situation. The members have to    |                                   |
| put their individual information  |                                   |
| together, and come to a shared    |                                   |
| understanding of the whole        |                                   |
| situation.                        |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| The whole situation corresponds   |                                   |
| to the big jigsaw picture. The    |                                   |
| information given to each member  |                                   |
| of the group corresponds to the   |                                   |
| individual blocks.                |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Members of the group can be       |                                   |
| tested individually for their     |                                   |
| understanding of the total        |                                   |
| situation. The group whose        |                                   |
| members individually best         |                                   |
| understand the total situation    |                                   |

| With the closing of the 5-year    |                                   |
| junior-college program at         |                                   |

| the 2-year post-high-school       |                                   |

| students to use English for       |                                   |

| One of my disappointments was     |                                   |
| using jigsaw in a English as      |                                   |
| Foreign Language Class in these   |                                   |
| really low-level classes.         |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |

| Another consequence occurs when   |                                   |
| students return to their home     |                                   |
| groups to teach their material.   |                                   |
| This can result in four or five   |                                   |
| boring lectures instead of one by |                                   |
| the teacher. In any case,         |                                   |
| students are too busy copying     |                                   |
| notes to make sense of the new    |                                   |
| and complementary information.    |                                   |

| My experience was:                |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I gave the 4 members of the group |                                   |
| a card each. Each member just     |                                   |
| read from the card and there was  |                                   |
| no discussion. The most able      |                                   |
| member then spoke, telling the    |                                   |
| group what the answers were.      |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Thinking back, the presence of    |                                   |
| the cards may have been           |                                   |
| counterproductive. Having         |                                   |
| answers, though an essential part |                                   |
| of coop learning, in being high   |                                   |
| stakes, might have stifled free   |                                   |
| thinking!                         |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I gave up asking these students   |                                   |
| to talk to each other in the FL,  |                                   |
| at least in requiring them to put |                                   |
| their own words in their mouths.  |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I was unable to continue with     |                                   |
| these and other more challenging, |                                   |
| open-ended tasks that required    |                                   |
| students to use English to solve  |                                   |
| problems. Instead the work I am   |                                   |
| requiring students to do now is   |                                   |
| focused on the language. This is  |                                   |
| not good, but it seems to have    |                                   |
| face validity for the students.   |                                   |
