The wikipedia article about the Russian Socialist Revolutionary Party at one point flagged the passive 'could not be reconciled' with 'by whom' in a sentence about the break-up of the party into two separate organizations.

	Increasingly, a faction of SR members formed
	rejecting the Provisional Government's authority
	and began to operate within the soviets with the
	Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. The divisions between
	the SR factions supporting the Provisional
	Government or the Petrograd Soviet could not be
	reconciled [by whom?] and the party split over
	the course of the summer of 1917 into the Right
	and Left SRs.

<sarcasm>Inquiring minds want to know. Who could not reconcile the differences of the factions?</sarcasm>

Some (but not all) passives (and not this passive) benefit from specifying the agent of the action. For example, it's good to hear opinions, but when we hear one, it is also good to know whose opinion it is. So, 'it is said/claimed that ..' without a 'who by' is not good.

The same applies in other cases, where 'it takes two to tango'.

Suppose two firms enter talks and after talks it is decided that a joint venture will be set up. It is senseless to ask who will the joint venture be set up by and who was the decision made by.

Is this editorial prejudice against the passive, or just a failure to understand that the passive of a verb which requires 2 cooperating (?) agents
