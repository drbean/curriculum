% *The* guy from San Antonio or *a* guy from San Antonio

I met a guy in the street from Fort Worth in Texas, called Peter.

Then on another occasion I met another guy from San Antonio in Texas, called Paul.

	I said to Paul, the second guy, 'I know a guy from Fort Worth.'
	He said, 'Not Peter? He's a student.'
	I said, 'Yes, he's doing a PhD.'

I guess the guys from Texas hang together.

I haven't seen Peter since that first occasion, but if I do see him again, I'll say to him,

	"I met Paul, the guy from San Antonio"

My question is why "the"? There are many guys from San Antonio, and I don't know, perhaps Peter knows other guys from San Antonio besides Paul.

I'm not going to say,

	"I met Paul, a guy from San Antonio."

Peter knows Paul. There are many guys from San Antonio, and perhaps Peter knows other guys from San Antonio besides Paul.

But still, Paul, *the* guy from San Antonio.

I think it's because the function of 'the' is to tell the listener that they can identify the referent from the information we have shared. I would be telling Peter that he knows who I am referring to when I say, 'the guy from San Anonio', because I shared the name 'Paul.'

Of course he could come back and say, 'I know 2 guys called Paul from San Antonio'. Or 'I don't know anyone called Paul.'

Then I could describe the Paul I met.
