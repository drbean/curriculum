% ChatGPT mistake with 'a' and 'the'

Grammarly does well with the past tense of 'lead' at
[https://www.grammarly.com/blog/led-lead/](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/led-lead/)
but ddging it, ChatGPT summarized it in August, 2024 as

    Learn the difference between led and lead, and how to
    spell the past tense of lead correctly.

    Led is the correct spelling, while lead is a common 
    misspelling and also a metal or a verb.

'A verb'? Which one? AI lost track of the argument there!

This is an AI
[CohesionAdhesion](CohesionAdhesion.html) mistake.

I don't see that summary on ddg now.

At the very least, it should be 'the verb', not 'a verb'.

##### The fix

I think it's not important to bring in 'metal' or 'verb'.

    Led is the correct spelling, while lead is a common 
    misspelling.

If they do have to be in, how about:

    Led is the correct spelling, while lead is a common 
    misspelling and also the name of the/a metal as
    well as a/the verb.

'A verb' becomes OK?
