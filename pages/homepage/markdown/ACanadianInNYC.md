% Finding a source on the Internet

In Canada, ordered out of the pool,
everyone gets out.
In the US, Lifeguard: 'Everyone out 
of the pool,' people start arguing.

I learned this from another teacher, first name
John, at Soonchunhyang U in Korea in 1997-98.

He was brought up in NYC and had a New York 
accent.

I tried searching for him on the Internet. He had 
a PhD from the New School in politics, and had 
apparently interviewed Spiro Agnew in 1973 on a 
day when Agnew was no doubt preoccupied with his 
exit from the vice-presidency.

I have never been able to find the doctoral 
dissertation, or reference to him.

This note will have to do as a substitute.
