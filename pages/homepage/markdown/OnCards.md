| Cards are good.                   |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| 1.  You are using less paper than |                                   |
|     a whole A4, or B5 piece.      |                                   |
| 2.  They are convenient to store  |                                   |
|     and can be recycled. When the |                                   |
|     students have finished using  |                                   |
|     them, you can collect them to |                                   |
|     use in another class.         |                                   |
| 3.  There is a lot less content   |                                   |
|     and thus they are less taxing |                                   |
|     of the students\' attention   |                                   |
|     span.                         |                                   |
| 4.  They are physical things that |                                   |
|     can be grouped and exchanged. |                                   |
|     We can have a competition to  |                                   |
|     be the first team to get rid  |                                   |
|     of all our cards, if we can:  |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| -   read the card.                |                                   |
| -   answer a question about the   |                                   |
|     card.                         |                                   |
| -   talk about the content of the |                                   |
|     card.                         |                                   |
| -   put matching cards together.  |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| A problem with matching cards was |                                   |
| students borrowing cards from     |                                   |
| different teams. To prevent this  |                                   |
| I started color coding the cards  |                                   |
| a team got. First I used color    |                                   |
| paper, but the care and           |                                   |
| preparation required to get the   |                                   |
| cards printed out in the right    |                                   |
| number on the different color     |                                   |
| sheets led me to color them by    |                                   |
| just drawing a line with a color  |                                   |
| pencil over the card.             |                                   |
| ![](pc230182scale.jpg) One        |                                   |
| problem with the color pencil is  |                                   |
| distinguishing a light blue and   |                                   |
| blue line, a pink and red line,   |                                   |
| and a gray and black line. And    |                                   |
| with more than 12 groups, but     |                                   |
| only 12 color pencils, I have to  |                                   |
| form a Blackandblue group and a   |                                   |
| Brownandgreen group.              |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| This semester I am trying just 8  |                                   |
| colors, Black, Blue, Brown and    |                                   |
| Green for the Dark Side, and      |                                   |
| Purple, Red, White, Yellow for    |                                   |
| the Light Side. But I have more   |                                   |
| groups than this, so I multiply   |                                   |
| the 8 colors by drawing 1,2, or 3 |                                   |
| lines on the cards to distinguish |                                   |
| a maximum of 24 groups.           |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Another problem with cards is the |                                   |
| adjustment and editing I have to  |                                   |
| do to texts to make sure they fit |                                   |
| in the limited space. This is     |                                   |
| very time-consuming.              |                                   |
