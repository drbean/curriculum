Kids are going to be sent to nursery school and then home schooled, perhaps after a bad experience in the nursery school, rather than the other way around.

They aren't home schooled and then sent to nursery school to complete or round out their education.

tinsoldier
:	wet nurse — Noun: 1. A woman hired to suckle another woman's child
:	suckle — Noun: 1. (obsolete) A teat., — Verb: 1. (transitive) To give suck to; to nurse at the breast, udder, or dugs., 2. (intransitive) To nurse; to suck milk from a nursing mother., 3. (transitive) To nurse from (a breast, nursing mother, etc.). https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/suckle

Those two senses of suckle: "to nurse a baby at the breast" and "to nurse from the breast", means nurse is an autoantonym, like 'cleave'? Or does it mean it's an ergative (labile) verb?

	"The baby nursed from the breast."
	"The mother nursed the baby at the breast"

	"The ship sailed from the harbor."
	"The pilot sailed the ship from the harbor."

I guess it's ergative (labile), rather than an antonym, because the meanings are the same, whereas in cleave the meanings are quite opposite.
