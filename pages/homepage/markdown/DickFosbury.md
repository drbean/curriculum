% Heaving self or flinging self over the bar?

A better name would be the Fosbury fling or sling
[FlingOrSling](FlingOrSling.html),
or Fosbury flip, but if it must have "flop" in it, the Fosbury flip-flop would be good.

Development of the style appears to have been a process of TrialAndError rather than the PracticalityOfGoodTheory. See
[Fosbury flop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fosbury_flop)

I think my interest in Fosbury is due to the fact that every morning I have to stow the bedding on a high shelf in a closet--a combination of high jumping and weight lifting. His creativity is inspirational.
