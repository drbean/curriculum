youtube.com Script

Hi.

Your teacher, Mr Sato, Mr K. Sato, gave me a ride from Shimonoseki to
Okayama.

My name is Greg. Hi.

G-R-E-G.

In kana.

グレーグ

I also have a name in characters, Chinese characters.

高来圭

高 means 'high' or 'tall'. I am tall.

来 means 'come'. I came to Japan in 1980.

圭? I don't know what 圭 means. But I know it's not a common character.

OK? So that's my Chinese-character name, 高来圭.

ONe of these characters is also in Mr Sato's name. I don't know if you
know Mr Sato's first name, But I think you can guess which character is
also in his name.

So the question is, Which of these 3 characters in my name is also in Mr
Sato's name?

1.  高
2.  来
3.  圭

How did you find the answer?

How do you write 'Sato' in Japanese? Are any of the characters in 'Sato'
in 高来圭?

What do you think Mr Sato's other name, his first name, is? Which
character do you think it sounds like? 高, 来, or 圭? That's the
character which Mr Sato and I both have in our names.
