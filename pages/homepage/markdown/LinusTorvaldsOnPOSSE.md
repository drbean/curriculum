% Throwing it out of the nest to see if it flies

_12/27  9:00_ The opposite to POSSE point of view is Linus Torvalds', which is like the cuckoo, letting the eggs it lays be hatched by other birds, by not maintaining his own data but putting it out for the public to maintain or not as it sees fit, a decision depending on whether it sees it to be fit or not. Which is strange for someone who developed a version control system in git.

I can't find a good citation. But in this December 2025 statement of his position on the Vizio GPL controversy,
https://social.kernel.org/objects/ec146b14-a7ae-44c8-928e-58968b2fd8ae he says he doesn't maintain a web presence, doesn't generally post and he's only posting to the Linux kernel mastodon instance as that's the easiest way to link the PDF of the court decision, which he says upholds his point of view.
