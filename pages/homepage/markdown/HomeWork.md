| The problem with homework is that |                                   |
| if there is only one set of       |                                   |
| homework, then only one student   |                                   |
| is going to do it, and the others |                                   |
| are going to copy it.             |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Of course this is an              |                                   |
| exaggeration. If the homework is  |                                   |
| an essay, then students are not   |                                   |
| as likely to copy it. If they are |                                   |
| motivated and autonomous, they    |                                   |
| are more likely to do their own   |                                   |
| homework.                         |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| But in the situation where the    |                                   |
| homework is made up of short      |                                   |
| answers or multiple choice        |                                   |
| questions, the type of homework   |                                   |
| which can be easily graded right  |                                   |
| or wrong, then students are more  |                                   |
| likely to copy from others.       |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| This makes parallel forms of the  |                                   |
| homework essential, which also    |                                   |
| makes generation of the homework  |                                   |
| by computer desirable.            |                                   |
