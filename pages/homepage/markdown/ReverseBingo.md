% Swapping the roles of caller and player

The players have the caller's card and 
the caller has a player's card. The 
cards the players are holding have all 
(and more) of the items on the card of 
the caller (let's just call them the 
gatekeeper).

GAME OVER when all the items on the 
gatekeeper's card have been crossed off. 
The gatekeeper also needs to be capable 
of deciding whether players were 
successfully able to call items, and of 
keeping a record of which items on the 
players' cards have been called to 
check players calling items twice.

Players who call items on the 
gatekeeper's card are Small Winners, 
over and above the reward they get for 
calling items.

This is perhaps an activity, rather than 
a game. Bingo is a receptive activity. 
ReReverseBingo is a productive activity.

See the perl script which creates 
ReverseBingo cards
