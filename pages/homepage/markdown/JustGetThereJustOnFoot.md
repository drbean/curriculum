% "Just Do" vs "Do Just"

Reading about a Japanese distinction, I wondered if the same distinction exists in English, one between

	'You can just get to the beach on foot',

and

	'You can get to the beach just on foot.'

One where the beach is within walking distance, and one where the beach is not accessible by road.

But which one with which?

And is the relationship between form and meaning one-on-one?

And are these expressions idiomatic?

English channel commenter noted

:    yes, but prosody could make it more complicated

    with the right prosody, the first could mean that there is no road
and the second could mean that it's in walking distance

    the first could also mean that the beach is almost but not quite outside of walking distance

Another English channel commenter noted

:    there's a distinction, but not the one you're thinking of. "You can get to the beach just on foot", means as you suggest that the beach is only accessible on foot; but "you can just get to the beach on foot" means that getting to the beach on foot is only just achievable; it takes a great effort, perhaps because it's a long way to walk, or because the person normally goes by wheelchair

    Or it could mean that it's straightforward to walk to the beach

    Though "almost but not quite outside walking distance" is the same idea as I was trying to convey

    "I can just walk to the beach" - it's at the limit of my ability

    "I can just walk to the beach" - it's so easy that I can get there on foot

    "I can walk just to the beach" - the beach is the only permissible destination

    â€¦ or the only feasible destination to reach on foot. This might come up when discussing a limited range of options. 

    "There are 3 places to hold a party this weekend. I don't have a car, and so I can walk just to the beach.

    "just about reach" means out of reach, by a small margin. "just reach" means in reach by a small margin

Other commenters said

:    'just about reach' means just within reach.
