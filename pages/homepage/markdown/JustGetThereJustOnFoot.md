% "Just Do" vs "Do Just"

Reading about a Japanese distinction, I wondered if the same distinction exists in English, one between

	'You can just get to the beach on foot',

	and

	'You can get to the beach just on foot.'

One where the beach is within walking distance, and one where the beach is not accessible by road.

But which one with which?

And is the relationship between form and meaning one-on-one?

And are these expressions idiomatic?
