% What is a game?

Wittgenstein apparently said that it is 
impossible to define what a game is in 
words, because there are many kinds of 
games united only by a family 
resemblance.

I argued once that fun was also not a 
defining characteristic, citing 
football, to which someone replied that 
it's fun if you win.

Fun however is why games are important 
in language learning, because motivation 
is important.

Language games may also result in 
language forms being repeated under 
circumscribed conditions for 
non-language reasons, which is 
also important.
