: Trying to remember the abstract I wrote for the KOTESOL conference.

The only subject which could make research worth doing: The learner as researcher studied by the teacher as researcher.

And I said I would give an account of what I would do at

Biggest shock is level of students, lower than accustomed to in Korea. Reminds me of accounts of lack of motivation of Japanese college students. But then I had the same problems in freshman listening labs in Korea.

Then I could blame the book, pass the buck onto the book. So I didn't have to try. It was only a filler, subordinate to the real language institute classes and writing classes in the English Department.

I remember thinking problems in Japanese colleges was only due to lack of good activities by teachers there, and that I wouldn't have a problem because of knowledge of activities.

I should've started before, when I got here. Problem was Yoko, perhaps.

I've already kind of set up an experimental and control group for the grammar/writing classes A and B. For the first week I did them equally. I have to find out from Yuru what she said about the two groups being formed on the basis of ability or something.

In the second week, I talked about experimental approach with A, after talking about it in grading their papers. By mistake I graded the B class papers first, and got to think about experimentation during the grading process.

Perhaps I wouldn't have done that if it had been the other way round. That was during Yoko's deciding to go back to Japan. I thought there was value for me in efforts to thinking about writing by doing a lot of writing on the students' books. Brought some things home to me. Confirmed for me some ideas or writing as bricklayer. Or rather thinking things through by writing about them.

I wrote some things down in another [exercise] book about writing: The language selves. The (have to look at it; transcribe it?)

The idea of getting theory and data into bed together is like the problem of writers getting their ideas and language skills to procreate. Writing fast is something I need to encourage, advocate.

: Just found this, my journal among the multicultural essays I was looking at. Flipping through from the back, I thought this one hasn't written anything. Got a surprise. It was mine.

But I was feeling good about the essays. Of course, not all. But a lot got the feeling of multiculturalism.

I need to move on to the idea of them experimenting and perhaps a way to do it would be to tell them I am reacting as according to whether they understood multiculturalism and my ideas of what I wanted them to be, not be, do.

Perhaps I could offer to instead give them feedback on what they wanted to do in the essay. That is everyone gets graded on what they were wanting to do in the essay (_rather than what they actually did do? I don't understand_).

Instead make them think about what they wanted to do. Some seemed to do great at rethinking their organization in the two drafts I required them to do in the two hours.

Will have to do a Dead Poets Society performance. We've got the stuff that will bust the world's brains out, but we are unrecognized. We don't get credit for the great ideas in our heads.

Will have to exult about the worth of their essays. Organization and ideas. Perhpas the first few were the best and have created a mood that the not-so-good others cannot destroy.

Will have to think about how to set up this invitation to experiment.

Students who failed to get the idea of multiculturalism but who did great at rethinking reorganizing between drafts one and two.

: Bringing the tape recorder into the room to record the lesson and the invitation to experiment with their writing.

Is the invitation to experiment with their learning or with their writing?

I will need to be very crystal clear and very convincing with what the invitation is because if I am going to be providing feedback, this feedback will be most likely what is being recorded as their grade in the course.

They will feel uncertainty that they are taking a big risk if their grade is goign to be determined by whether an experiment is successful or not. Perhaps they will prefer safety, the status quo.

It will be difficult for me to answer the questions they may ask. I may not be satisfied with the questions they want to ask. We will have to negotiate the questions.
