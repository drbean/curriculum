: Trying to remember the abstract I wrote for the KOTESOL conference.

The only subject which could make research worth doing: The learner as researcher studied by the teacher as researcher.

And I said I would give an account of what I would do at

Biggest shock is level of students, lower than accustomed to in Korea. Reminds me of accounts of lack of motivation of Japanese college students. But then I had the same problems in freshman listening labs in Korea.

Then I could blame the book, pass the buck onto the book. So I didn't have to try. It was only a filler, subordinate to the real language institute classes and writing classes in the English Department.

I remember thinking problems in Japanese colleges was only due to lack of good activities by teachers there, and that I wouldn't have a problem because of knowledge of activities.

I should've started before, when I got here. Problem was Yoko, perhaps.

I've already kind of set up an experimental and control group for the grammar/writing classes A and B. For the first week I did them equally. I have to find out from Yuru what she said about the two groups being formed on the basis of ability or something.

In the second week, I talked about experimental approach with A, after talking about it in grading their papers. By mistake I graded the B class papers first, and got to think about experimentation during the grading process.

Perhaps I wouldn't have done that if it had been the other way round. That was during Yoko's deciding to go back to Japan. I thought there was value for me in efforts to thinking about writing by doing a lot of writing on the students' books. Brought some things home to me. Confirmed for me some ideas or writing as bricklayer. Or rather thinking things through by writing about them.

I wrote some things down in another [exercise] book about writing: The language selves. The (have to look at it; transcribe it?)

The idea of getting theory and data into bed together is like the problem of writers getting their ideas and language skills to procreate. Writing fast is something I need to encourage, advocate.
