% Journaling in 2000, The teacher as action researcher

Did I also see this as material for an article with Tim Newfield that we shortly considered, or was that at a different time?

I apparently stopped writing the journals when I started preparing reports for classes before lessons. Probably the time and effort required to write them was the real reason. The tapes no longer exist.
