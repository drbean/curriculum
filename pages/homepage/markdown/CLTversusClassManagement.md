% The failure of Communicative Language Teaching

Contemporary approaches to the teaching of English emphasize the instrumentality of the language. Teachers try to get students to learn the language by giving them a purpose to use it, by focusing their attention on meaning and by making instruction relevant to their non-educational goals, relevant to their lives outside the classroom.

If this was in part a result of modern developments in the understanding of language, it was also a reaction to the failure of traditional approaches to teaching which were based on more academically-oriented understandings of scholars interested in language as a thing in itself, intent on stripping away from the study of language everything which was not language, and not see language as a means to an end, but rather regard language study as an end in itself.
