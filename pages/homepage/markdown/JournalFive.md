I am going to write this then listen to the 60 minutes of tape I recorded and add changes in brackets.

This lesson was a lot easier as I didn't have the 3 tape recorders & OHP to bring in in the 10 minutes between the previous class (3C) or 10 minutes after lunch (3D). I told the class that I would be reverting to recorders next week, but will I really?

I decided to ~~follow~~ talk about things I've always wanted to talk about because it was what interested me but didn't feel I was justified in taking time to discuss. I decided to discuss with them ~~the~~ language, language learning and language teaching issues I always wanted to have teacher ed classes so that I could discuss.

I started out by just talking for --12-15-- minutes about taping & how this was for Tim [Newfields] & how me, Tim and them could study this together. I talked in Japanese, my & their first L2, はげむために.

Then I started talking about who was the best English speaker, giving examples of Ruby, who most interactive, Linda, whose pronunciation was good but I hadn't noticed (For me this meant this was an indication that what best speaker meant was an opinion) & someone else (was it Warren) Bobo, who did well on tests but didn't do much in class. Who was best?

I said ~~I would give~~thinking who was best was important because it was important to think about what good speaking is. Deciding who was best required some sort of criteria. ~~I said consensus was~~ I said in the groups we would decide who was best. I didn't explain my scoring scheme very well, but I ~~said~~ wrote I would give a high score if many other people agreed with your choice & a low score if they didn't. The idea was to get them to talk about criteria again. Others' criteria would probably be right? I hadn't thought this thru too clearly ~~but~~ I ~~was~~ have been thinking about answer weighting in other courses. So your score was the number out of 12 groups who agreed with your choice of best speaker.

They then moved into groups (looking at gradebook at same time?) & voted. Scores were Warren. I said there were no right answers. I didn't interact very much with Warren. I should have talked to her in front of class & ask about what this meant for language learning.
