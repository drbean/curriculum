| Chinmin Institute of Technology   |                                   |
| is closing down its AFL           |                                   |
| Department, and I am now looking  |                                   |
| for another job, so I wonder if   |                                   |
| you have any contract-based       |                                   |
| positions teaching English in the |                                   |
| AFL department at your            |                                   |
| university. I think I would be    |                                   |
| well-suited for teaching in your  |                                   |
| department.                       |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| For the seven years I have been   |                                   |
| in Taiwan at Chinmin, I have been |                                   |
| working with lower-level,         |                                   |
| unmotivated students. With these  |                                   |
| students, I had to rework the way |                                   |
| I teach. I had to move away from  |                                   |
| pairwork and groupwork to work    |                                   |
| with the whole class, because the |                                   |
| students were generally unwilling |                                   |
| to use English unless the teacher |                                   |
| was observing them.               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| But this was perhaps a blessing   |                                   |
| in disguise. It forced me to      |                                   |
| develop a number of innovative    |                                   |
| activities to get the students to |                                   |
| use English. For example, for     |                                   |
| exams I had them do pair          |                                   |
| dictations, each student reading  |                                   |
| one half of a dialogue to their   |                                   |
| partner, and writing down their   |                                   |
| partner\'s lines.                 |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Successes such as these were      |                                   |
| rewarding, but whether I achieved |                                   |
| a lot of what I set out to        |                                   |
| achieve in my teaching is         |                                   |
| debatable. Overall, however, I    |                                   |
| think I did do an excellent job   |                                   |
| of creating favorable attitudes   |                                   |
| to English among these students,  |                                   |
| at the same time as I             |                                   |
| significantly raised their levels |                                   |
| of achievement. I certainly seem  |                                   |
| to have gained their respect.     |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| My success was partly the result  |                                   |
| of my technique, and partly the   |                                   |
| result of the personal warmth I   |                                   |
| felt and showed to them as my     |                                   |
| students. No doubt the latter is  |                                   |
| more important than the former. I |                                   |
| place more importance on the      |                                   |
| technique however. I wish to      |                                   |
| continue developing that          |                                   |
| technique.                        |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| Now, I am ready to apply the      |                                   |
| lessons I have learned here to    |                                   |
| the practice I developed before   |                                   |
| in Korea where I taught           |                                   |
| university students. I believe I  |                                   |
| am well suited to teaching at the |                                   |
| university level. Even though my  |                                   |
| master\'s is not in TESOL, my     |                                   |
| native intelligence, my           |                                   |
| background in psychology and my   |                                   |
| extensive reading in TESOL and    |                                   |
| applied linguistics fit me for an |                                   |
| academic position.                |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| However, I am more interested in  |                                   |
| the practice, that is, in         |                                   |
| teaching itself, than in the      |                                   |
| theory, that is, in knowledge     |                                   |
| about learning and language. At   |                                   |
| the same time, I recognize, as    |                                   |
| Kurt Lewin noted, that there is   |                                   |
| nothing as practical as a good    |                                   |
| theory. I hope that your          |                                   |
| department is also interested in  |                                   |
| such a collaboration between      |                                   |
| theory and practice. If it is, I  |                                   |
| would enjoy working with you      |                                   |
