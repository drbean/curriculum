# 3C

I played the 3 tapes 3 times. I don't think they really had a good idea of which were best. I used 3D tapes. Next time I will do 3C's and 3D's and perhaps just 2 tapes. Make it easy.

Then what happened? This was after listening to their own tapes in areas or before?

I don't know if this was --after-- next or near the end, but I felt the need for another quiz. This was improvised. The week before I hadn't done any quiz. Getting them to record again rather than working on a quiz was probably the reason for this. I want--ed-- to continue with quizzes. I'm grading each week and posting continuing grade situation on the wall.

The quiz: 

1. Did your voice sound funny?
2. Did your partner's voice sound funny?
3. Did you do a good job?

Give yourself a score out of 3.

Probably before this I talked about recording again for homework. "I'm afraid I won't be able to work this weekend." p96. Names on tapes, tape boxes, etc. I started by thinking, Make their own situation--Expressways find drill--but suddenly changed my mind to keep in step with 3D, who had done only one drill instead of all 5 like 3C, and because I hadn't prepared them for doing guided role play rather than just drill. Although they did it last semester in class when I --gave them the-- went round and graded it.

These questions were similar to the discussion questions, which I didn't think they did. This was getting close to the end. I just collected them. I had the idea of totalling the score with 

1. Yes = 1, No = 0
2. Yes = 0, No = 1
3. Self-evaluation score

Then as they wer talking out the door, I remembered I had given them homework: Write 2 (?) lines about why did I ask you to do the recording. I only got 6/46 books. "Why do I want you to record conversations?"

| Annie: Learn to speak correct conversations.
| Lina: Learn how to speak correct conversation.
| Tammy: Let us learn how to correct speaking English
| Fanny: Let us learn how to speaking and listening
| 310: Let me learn how to speak English
| Warren: Let me learn to speak more English in conversation class

Did I forget anything?

# 3D

Generally the same course of events, but I did only 1 listening exercise, p95 at start (& another later?) for no reward. Couldn't get people to point (1 person at back did) so just took answers (no knock out). Then read picture book story (I had a lesson plan on the board:

| story
| listening
| tape
| quiz
| homework

I can't remember exactly what I wrote or the --exact actual-- order)

I talked about how I was "impressed" by the tapes. Why can't you do that in class, I asked. I talked about intonation. How they went:

	Sure↓ If↓ you↓ don't↓ mind↓

I wrote and practiced the Chinese way

	Would↓ you↓ like↓ me↓ to↓ set↓ up↓  the conference room?

& the English way (only 1 or 2 stresses in sentence)

I also talked about right grammar (plural object pronouns)

(Didn't talk about someone with good intonation as I did in 3C mentioning Linda, who wasn't there in 3C as it turned out.)

Then said areas would play tapes, others would listen & --answer-- (discuss) think about 3 questions:

1. intonation
2. grammar
3. fluency (hesitancy: gave example)


(or was that for the quiz on the 3 tapes. --Perhaps-- I think I didn't have any questions/ask them to discuss)

This went better than 3C. I assigned 4 people in areas to handle the players. Others were to listen, draw closer perhaps. Although player operators were --not-- slow, didn't seek out tapes, finally snatches of conversation were heard in 4 corners. I then stopped them and did the quiz. Same as before, except order of tapes was different and number 1 was best.

It required all my concentration to play tapes. I did second listening exercise, talked about next week's homework, collected homework and ended. Lots more homework collected.

Questions

1. Did your voice sound funny
2  Did your partner's voice sound funny
3. Did you do the conversation well

Then I started to say, Give score of 

1. Yes=1, No=0
2. Yes=0, No=0

but notedsomeone (CArl?) changing answers so stopped and collected quiz slips.

According to what student wrote in --book--, questions for consideration during listening in areas were 

1. Does my voice sound funny
2. How can I do better
3. What score would I give myself

I have to record next week
