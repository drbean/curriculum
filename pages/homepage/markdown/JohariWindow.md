% Breaking the self down

Thinks more about my picture of 'you':

The Johari Window breaks down one's self (or self-image?) into what others and oneself know/don't know about the self.

There are 4 panes or quadrants.

* The open self
* The hidden self
* The blind self
* The unknown self

+------------------------+--------------------------------+
| Views on self          |      As viewed by self         |
|                        +------------+-------------------+
|                        |*unknown*   | *known*           |
+------------+-----------+------------+-------------------+
| As viewed  |  *unknown*| Unconscious| Private self      |
| by others  |           |            | (Pretender self)  |
|            +-----------+------------+-------------------+
|            |  *known*  | Blind spot | Public (open) self|
+------------+-----------+------------+-------------------+

How to interface that window with a window on 'you'?

Also, knowledge is correct/justified belief.

Johari Window users recognize and grapple with the 
belief/knowledge distinction, but breaking the
distinction out into

* 1. no idea
* 2. false/contested belief/understanding
* 3. true belief/understanding.

The join between the 2 windows is joint mis-/understanding of each other? 2/2
