% Breaking the self down

Thinks more about my picture of 'you': The Johari Window breaks down one's self-image into what others and oneself know/don't know about the self. How to interface that window with a window on 'you'? Also, knowledge is correct/justified belief. Rebreaking the window's non-/knowledge distinction into 1. no idea 2. false/contested belief/understanding 3. true belief/understanding. The join between the 2 windows is joint mis-/understanding of each other? 2/2
