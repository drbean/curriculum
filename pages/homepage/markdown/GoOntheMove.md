% "On the move", "on the go": What is the difference

:	on the move — Adjective: 1. Changing location; in motion https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/on_the_move

	on the go — Prepositional phrase: 1. (idiomatic) Actively traveling; busy; moving often., 2. In progress; having started. https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/on_the_go

What is the difference in the meaning of 'move' and 'go' that would allow you to compose the difference in 'on the move' and 'on the go' from it?

Keywords from the wiktionary definitions, I think, are:

*	on the move: in motion
*	on the go: busy

After work as everyone heads home, on the roads everyone's on the move.

"You're on the go today! I haven't seen you sit down all morning!"

I don't think there is anything in the meaning of 'go' and 'move' that would allow you to say that's the difference between 'on the go' and 'on the move.'

Despite that, I'm a believer in the composition of the meaning of a sentence from the words in it.
