Have I put this on disk or not?

~~Can use the Internet to find out about~~

April 5-6 was Spring break

Yoko went to Japan, so I had to look after the dog, taking it to the dormitory. The week before I was thinking about what to do. I could only think of the song (about)

| Language
| Ah yeh
| Never never ceases to 
| Amaze me
| Now you really can
| Learn
| Something from
| Language
| 
| Situation out of control
| A state disconcerting
| Can't say anything about language
| Doesn't stay still long enough
| ¶
| Got to got to, Try to succeed
| Maybe if we think hard, We will succeed
| Let's talk about it, Help each other
| Try things, & find out
| ¶
| What's language go to do, got to do with it?
| What's language but a second hand emotion.

But somewhere I also decided to do best speaker/worst speaker in group. I woke up very early on April 12 and thought about how Yoko gets best ~~quiz~~ test results in her Chinese class but is worst speaker.

# 3C April 13

Did midterm exam prep first telling them ~~where~~ what parts of the book would be tested. They are noisier than 3D. I checked Walkman from time to time & turned it back on when it stopped by itself. Then I sang the song. I think they appreciated it more than 3D. But I couldn't get them to listen when I started to talk about Yoko & her class.

Ruby, Amy, Mavies, Muriel, Rachel were looking to sing a song too, ~~but they couldn't~~ I changed my mind and tried to get them to come to the front to sing but couldn't. I then went back to Yoko & whether Japanese or Chinese are better speakers of English. I connected this with Warren (the class's choice as best student) not being the best speaker. I talked about last week's listening quiz and how Warren got 2 wrong but in another group noone got any wrong.

I then set them the task of choosing who in their group was:

1. the best speaker
2. speaker who needed most help (both opinions)
3. best student
4. worst student (facts: last semester grades dependent)

(haven't graded them yet) & told them to move into groups. I gave out last week's quiz papers too. I think they may have looked at them. They had been sitting in ordinary class arrangement. This was about the end of the first hour.

During the break drew a seating chart on the board. In second hour, first finished discussion, handed in papers. Then before listening quiz (p115?) got them individually to do the dialogue, told them this would help them & ~~walked~~ snuck around giving participation points. Had to run & get tape recorder. I forgot it. Listening quiz I got one representative from each of 12 groups at a time to come to the front & listen & write on the board (all weakest, next, next, best). The aim was to stop people telling other members of the group or other groups the answer. I saw some people looking at tapescript in back which I hadn't seen before. ~~Not many~~ A few people at board looked around, a few people called out, but noone made any mistakes. I was surprised & a bit disappointed. I think they were ~~cheating~~ "cheating" cooperating before hearing the tape. Some people did not come to the board or I penalized groups calling out. I don't know if I remembered to copy down results.

I thought I had more material this time. There was less padding. It took a long time to write the words of the song on the board.

# 3D April 14

Wrote some words of song before start. Forgot to put gradesheet quickly. Stopped writing midway. Started lesson & started writing exam prep help. Parts in book, same as ˇC. Think I also told 3D there would be 50 questions multiple-choice. Went on to song. Not as good as 3C. I was very tired. Noone appeared to want to sing after. Perhaps I didn't sing as long.

Then talked about Yoko. They were more interested in hearing about her, I thought. I forget if they asked me any questions. 3D's choice of best speaker got 5/6 [in previous week's listening quiz] wrong. Not so good speakers got them all right. I think I also got them to change into groups but I think I did it before telling them the whole of the task.

End of first hour. I had forgotten to turn tape over or start it in second hour. 
During break, I added up homework points & entered bookwork score in grading book so I could return books even tho there wasn't anything in most books that could help in midterm.

I seemed to have a harder time people collecting previous week's quiz results than in 3D [3C]. They were going to write their [best/worst speaker/student] choice on them. They finished activity before I was ready to collect papers.

I then told them to practice dialogue ahead of listening. I think I got more people practicing than in 3C or before. Listening same as 3C. They didn't understand procedure as quickly. The weakest people first wrote different answers (last week's listening test, I think). I had problem finding tape in this class (or other). Some people were writing answer before end of taped question. They smiled after. I was a bit disappointed I guess but tried to put my best face on it.

~~After~~ At end of class, tried to finish entering bookwork scores for last students as class was ending. Class thought I ~~still~~ wanted them to wait. I had told them they could go a little early.
