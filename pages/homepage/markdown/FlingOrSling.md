% Does the form convey the meaning?

`fling`, `sling` and `swing`.

| #phonestheme,
| #soundsymbolism and
| #iconicity, anyone?

All describe movement in an arc. Is there any difference between `sling` and `fling`? The difference of being directed at a target, or not?

We can add `slip` to movement in an arc--down and along.

`sling the backpack up on the truck` versus `fling the towel around the waist` 
[https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/](https://www.english-corpora.org/coca/)
has `sling/fling the ball` and `slung the strap/flung the door` as top cites. No cites of my examples, so no diff? For balls, sure, but `sling the door/fling the door`?, surely not.

So the difference in meaning between `fling` and `sling` is not clear.
