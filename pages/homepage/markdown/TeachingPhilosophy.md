| Teaching is a struggle between    |                                   |
| the ideal and the real, what we   |                                   |
| have and what we want to have, ie |                                   |
| the vision we have for the        |                                   |
| students.                         |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| The ideal student is              |                                   |
| intrinsically motivated and comes |                                   |
| to us already with a basic        |                                   |
| knowledge of the language. He or  |                                   |
| she is outgoing and happy,        |                                   |
| interested in linguistics and the |                                   |
| learning process.                 |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| But the students I have are not   |                                   |
| motivated, and have little        |                                   |
| knowledge of the language. Often  |                                   |
| they are withdrawn and shy, with  |                                   |
| family problems, or other causes  |                                   |
| of unhappiness. They are often    |                                   |
| not interested in language or in  |                                   |
| learning. They are not good at    |                                   |
| learning languages.               |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| How does the teacher transform    |                                   |
| these students into the ideal     |                                   |
| student?                          |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| With the ideal student, you can   |                                   |
| use the ideal teaching method,    |                                   |
| which is communicative and        |                                   |
| task-based, uses pairwork and     |                                   |
| groupwork, and emphasizes         |                                   |
| autonomous learning.              |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| This is how I used to teach       |                                   |
| English at universities in Korea. |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| But now I\'m teaching in an       |                                   |
| institute of technology in Taiwan |                                   |
| and I have students who are not   |                                   |
| ideal. This has been a challenge. |                                   |
| I have developed a style which is |                                   |
| distinctive, I think.             |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| It emphasizes dictation,          |                                   |
| whole-class work, and incentive   |                                   |
| systems. I use cards a lot.       |                                   |
