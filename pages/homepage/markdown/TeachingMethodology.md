| Whist is a kind of 4-hand card ga |                                   |
| me like bridge, but a whist tourn |                                   |
| ament                             |                                   |
| is a procedure for matching playe |                                   |
| rs, such that each player partner |                                   |
| s every                           |                                   |
| other player once and opposes eve |                                   |
| ry other player twice.            |                                   |
|                                   |                                   |
| I tried this out in my conversati |                                   |
| on classes, doing jigsaw activiti |                                   |
| es, but                           |                                   |
| the students were unable to carry |                                   |
|  out conversations in groups of 4 |                                   |
|  in the                           |                                   |
| L2. So I put whist tournaments as |                                   |
| ide, and worked with other tourna |                                   |
| ment                              |                                   |
| schedules.                        |                                   |

| Another variation was to have two |                                   |
|  teams of two players each compet |                                   |
| ing to                            |                                   |
| fill in a crossword. Which team c |                                   |
| ould fill in more letters of the  |                                   |
| grid?                             |                                   |
| This was more successful, but was |                                   |
| n't really a vehicle for practici |                                   |
