## The unexamined life is not worth living--Socrates

What should be your aim living life, working?

To make money, OK.

But also, to examine your actions and thoughts
and OTHERS' actions and thoughts.

## Aim of conflict session

- To get you to think like a mediator/facilitator (helper) of negotiation.
- Help people make good decisions about their actions when there is conflict.

## Conflict in the company

A controlled community where we spend a large part of our lives.

Management/the bosses have the power

but 

Labor/the workers have the numbers

## Conflict between individuals

## Conflict between companies

One company thinks the other company isn't living up to the contract.

## Same question, applied to this class

- Dr Bean is a manager.
- The students are the workers.

In what areas is there conflict between Dr Bean and the students?

# The framework

## making a bigger pie OR dividing the pie

Is there an opportunity to create value as well as distribute value

Is it a zero-sum game? OR a win-win situation

You scratch my back and I'll scratch yours.

OR

I win, you lose.

## cooperative <-> competitive

- cooperative <-> competitive
- Creating value <-> distributive
- win-win situation  <-> zero-sum game

(everyone wins) (you scratch my back, I'll scratch yours)

## Examples of creating a bigger pie or not

Buying a car

- You want the car
- The car owner wants the money

Buying bananas

- Bananas are now 15NT per kg

Choose one of these in which it is possible/impossible
to create a bigger pie.

## First, is there a negotiation?

If there is no negotiation, then the cooperative <-> competitive dimension does not apply

## I am interested in negotiating about the grade

I don't think normally teachers and students negotiate the grade.

There is conflict, teachers want students to do more work than students have time for.

What are you willing to offer?

[Framework](http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/conflict/jigsaw_framework_0.pdf)

## Communication: Empathy OR assertiveness

Is communication good?

- Do the 2 speakers express empathy for the other speaker?
- Do the 2 speakers assert the rightness of their position?

# Mnookin on empathy and assertiveness versus Nicholson on managers and motivation {.allowframebreaks}


## Mnookin:

The second tension: empathy and assertiveness.

1. Empathy: the ability in a non-judgmental way to describe your understanding of the other person's needs, interests, concerns.
2: Assertiveness: the capacity, in a persuasive way, to articulate your own needs and interests and concerns.

Some people are lousy listeners. When they're listening, it's always, 'Yes, but'. They're composing in their own mind what their rebuttal's going to be.

On the other hand, some people are terrific at putting themselves in the other person's shoes.

## Nicholson:

1. Everyone is unique and different. And different to the way that you as a manager think. You need to try to know what the world looks for them, through their eyes.

2. You need to be good at asking questions and listening to people. You need to ask questions that really tell you about what a person's drivers, or unique motivators are. You need to ask questions to find out what the people are concerned about.


## Principal OR agent

- Is the speaker acting in the place of someone else? Is the conflict their own conflict?
- Or are they like a spokesperson representing someone else in the conflict?

## 朝三幕四

[Monkeys get 4 & 3 instead of 3 & 4](http://www.chinapage.com/story/monkeyfeed.html)

Are the monkeys stupid? No, no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no,  no, 

- 朝三暮四 contradict one's own words, fickle, undecided in mind;
- Analyze the story in terms of the cooperative-competitive dimension and empathy-assertiveness dimension.
- The monkeys are NOT stupid. Perhaps they prefer a bigger breakfast and smaller dinner.
- Is this a zero-sum game, or win-win situation

## Role play--the champions

[Debtor role play](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmP1GMdm47g)
00:15

The first champion spent a lot of money on their credit card and now cannot pay.
The second champion is a bank officer, requesting the first champion to say how they will pay.

Role play the discussion.

## Role play--the spokespersons

The 2 spokespersons say:

1. Something the champions said.
2. What the listeners thought.
3. In terms of the framework, whether the champions were:
	
	a. concerned about expanding the pie, or dividing the pie.
	b. good communicators, showing empathy &/or assertiveness.
	c. negotiating for people not at the table (ie stakeholders.)

Dr Bean will listen to the spokespersons and choose the winners.

During the _____(1), both sides focused _____(2) on claiming as _____(3) a slice as possible of what they saw as a _____(4) pie. They often exhibited a _____(5) mindset, and negotiated as if whatever _____(6) the other party gained must necessarily _____(7) themselves. The exclusive focus on _____(8) gain typically prevents the sharing of _____(9) that can lead to _____(10) the pie. It can also lead to the use of hardball _____(11) and an increase in the _____(12). Each side _____(13) a variety of hard-bargaining _____(14) in the attempt to _____(15) the other.
_____(16) between the two sides was also poor. Pastreich said: “I came to understand how important it was for me to _____(17) to the other side. The musicians were angry with me because they _____(18) I wasn’t even _____(19) to what they were _____(20).

## You are divorcing

You are upset with your partner, but you don't want the divorce to hurt your children.

In particular, you don't want your partner to turn your kids against you by what he/she says to them about you.

what is in the best interests of the children?

You need to cooperate with him/her to work out some way the children can be protected by you and your partner in a way that is satisfactory to you.

This includes child support, money to support the children and custody, who the children are going to live with and who is going to raise them.

Share information that will help you enlarge the pie.

## Which of the 3 dimensions do Olivier and Todd exhibit

- The first speaker (the odd numbered group's speaker) will argue Olivier wants to expand the pie, is empathetic, and the principal and Todd isn't or doesn't.
- The second speaker (the even numbered group's speaker) will argue Todd wants to expand the pie, is empathetic, and the principal and Olivier isn't or doesn't.

* The group will decide which speaker presented the better argument.
* 2 spokespersons (not the speakers) will stand up and report to the class the discussion and the result.
* Before the discussion, I will walk around looking at books. Have you written questions?

## The spokespersons will say:

The 2 spokespersons say:

1. Something the champions said. eg Our champion said Todd wants to help Olivier. He wants to expand the pie
2. What the listeners thought. eg We thought our champion spoke more and did a better job.
3. In terms of the framework, whether the champions were:
	
	a. concerned about expanding the pie, or dividing the pie.
	b. good communicators, showing empathy &/or assertiveness.
	c. negotiating for people not at the table (ie stakeholders.)

Dr Bean will listen to the spokespersons and choose the winners, the group of the spokesperson who gave the best report.
