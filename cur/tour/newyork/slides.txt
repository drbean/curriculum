# Homework

## Dictation

- [http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/DictationExercises.html ](http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/DictationExercises.html)

## Tour guide

Not a touristy location

*Any* location overseas.

5 pictures, 3 sentences about each picture.

You also have to make a google map.

# Exam Week 13

## What the tourists do {.allowframebreaks}

4 tour groups of 15 (-1) tourists from Blue, Green, Pink and White countries

Wear comfortable shoes, because you will be walking around the classroom 15 times in 2 hours.

- You fly to the country you are visiting.
- a tour guide comes to meet you at the first location.
- You follow the guide (walk) to the second, third, fourth, and fifth location, around the room.
- You tip the guide, 4, 6 or 7 beans. The guide leaves.
- You fly home.

Repeat.


## What the tour guide does {.allowframebreaks}

One person (a tour guide) from another country tells the others about his/her walk overseas. The places on the walk must be connected. It must be possible to walk from one place to all the other places.

Tourguides, you do not leave your country after the tour. Tour guides do not move clockwise to join the next group. They just go back to join their fellow countrymen/women and particpate in the next tour.

The others decide what grade to give her, 4, 6, or 7 beans. Each group has only 1215 beans to award the 15 tour guides.

The group will decide the grade on the basis of the interest of the talk and her/his performance as a tour guide.

## Managing the beans

Before the tourist guide leaves, the tourists individually decide how much to "tip" her/him by giving 4, 6, or 7. Each tourist, try to keep equal numbers of 4, 6 and 7 bean notes, so that you don't run out of any one note, and so that you can give the first through last tour guide the number of beans they are entitled to.

## Deciding how many beans {.allowframebreaks}

Criteria

1. Could you understand what he/she said?
2. Was what they said interesting?
3. Were they well prepared to be a tour guide?
4. Did they speak about 5 places connected by a walk?
5. Did they say 3 things about each place?
6. How long did they speak?
7. What was the reaction of the other tourists?
8. Did tourists ask questions?

## Distribution of 3-, 4-, and 5-bean tips {.allowframebreaks}

Try to give equal numbers of 3, 4 and 5 beans.

- 4 beans if you can't understand and it isn't interesting and they don't speak very long.
- 6 beans if you think they did a good job and you understood what they said.
- 7 beans if you wished you could do as well as they did, because they satisfied all the 8 criteria.

## Responsibilities {.allowframebreaks}

The next tour guide from a country will be chosen at random.

For the Front Left tour group from the Yellow country, the tour guides will come from the Front Right Group, in the Blue country.

For the Front Right tour group from the Blue country, the tour guides will come from the Back Right Group, in the Pink country.

For the Back Left tour group from the White country, the tour guides will come from the Front Left Group, in the Yellow country.


## Example {.allowframebreaks}

Take the Front Left, Yellow tour group

They will wear yellow badges. Make sure the paper clip does not tear your clothes

1. Let's suppose Ula is their first tour guide.
2. The Yellow tour group flies (in the same Front Left spot).
3. Ula appears, takes the Yellow flag and introduces the first place (in the same Front Left spot).
4. She leads the group to the Front Right spot (the second place introduced).
5. In turn the group proceed to the Back Right spot and Back Left spot (for the third and fourth place introduced).
6. The Yellow group returns to the Front Left spot (and the fifth and last place is introduced).
7. The Yellow group pays/tips Ula.
8. The Yellow group flies home (in the same Front Left spot). And Ula puts down the flag, and returns to her country/group, where she becomes a tourist again.

## Penalties

- If you are tardy, you lose 20 percent.
- If you are a [straggler ](http://www.google.com.tw/search?q=%22+straggler%22&num=100&gws_rd=ssl&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X)
  , you lose 5 percent each time.
- Keep your badge on at all times, or lose 10 percent.
- If Dr Bean has to check you for some other reason, like in the wrong group, you lose 10 percent each time.

Try to keep a track of how many 3-, 4- and 5-bean tips you are giving. This can only be a rough estimate. Don't worry about that.

Dr Bean will ask you after the -2 C tour guides and -4 C tour guides have got their tips.

## Exam debriefing

I think it went well.

I want to do something similar in Weeks 9, 13 and 18

Week 9 will probably be describing some places you walked to in your childhood. eg school, and the places you passed on the way.

Uta gave me beans she collected from seniors and other students. She said she has 3 more beans than the total grades recorded. Please speak up if your name is not on this list and you gave her beans.

- [http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/FLA0003/g1.yaml ](http://web.nuu.edu.tw/~greg/FLA0003/g1.yaml)

Probably was Brian.

# Peer evaluation in midterm exam--A trip down Memory Lane

## Every student gives the tour guide a four-, six- or seven-bean note of the right color. {.allowframebreaks}

After the tour presentation, the tour guide "dies and goes to heaven" and leaves his/her beans 
because [You can't take it with you](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/you-can-t-take-it-with-you)

The tour guide coming from the previous world inherits the beans left by the "dying" tour guide. This is a different sort of money to the money he/she had in the previous world. She should use the money she inherits when she enters the new world, not the different color beans from the old country. That is her grade.

Anyone presenting mixed-color notes as her grade loses 5 percent.

There are four worlds/countries, the Blue (1-1,2,3,4), Pink (2-1,2,3,4), White (3-1,2,3,4) and Yellow (4-1,2,3,4).

As the tour guide dies, the tourist line up and the tour guide goes down the line with an envelope and each of the tourists puts a note in the envelope, as
["spirit money"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joss_paper).


## Procedure

1. Tour guide gives up her beans, because you can't take it with you.
2. Tour guide gives her talk.
3. Tour guide gets spirit money/tips from every tourist.
4. Tour guide goes to next world, inherits the different color beans from the tour guide who just died and becomes a tourist in the new country/world.



## Bean economy II {.allowframebreaks}

Each of the 14 tourists in the group of 15 has 81 beans, in the form of

- 4 four-bean notes,
- 5 six-bean notes and
- 5 seven-bean notes.

Check you have all these 14 notes. {.allowframebreaks}

This is good for an average of 81 beans for each tourist guide.

## Possible results {.allowframebreaks}

If every tourist gives the tourguide 4 beans, the guide gets 56 beans, a failing grade.

If every tourist gives the tourguide 6 beans, the guide gets 84 beans, an average grade.

If every tourist gives the tourguide 7 beans, the guide gets 98 beans, a very good grade.

You must give each tour guide one note, either 4, 6, or 7 beans. You have 14 notes for 14 tour guides.

Even if the last tourguide didn't do a good job, if you have only the 7-bean note left, you must give her the 7-bean note.

The tourguide will count the number of notes he/she gets.

Try to keep a track of how many 4-, 6- and 7-bean tips you are giving. This can only be a rough estimate. Don't worry about that.

Dr Bean will ask you after the -2 C tour guides and -4 C tour guides have got their tips.

Brian will joing the White World/Country. Joe will be my assistant. if he is a good assistant, I give him 100%. If not, a lesser score.

Please try to be the tourguide in the right order.

I think we will try to give each guide 2 minutes. We may have to speed up at the end. You don't have to talk for 2 minutes if you don't like. You can answer questions, if there are any.

If someone is absent, tell me. I will give a responsible tourist in the tour group those beans. When it is that absent person's turn to speak, everyone in the group must give me a 4-bean note.

If they are tardy, they lose 20 percent. They get back the beans that the responsible tourist hasn't used.

If they arrive after it is their turn to speak they get 14 4-bean notes I collected.

If you do not or cannot give your tourguide a note, tell me or Joe. We will make up the lost note, but your grade goes down 5 percent.
That is if you lose beans, your grade goes down 5 percent.

Keep the notes fastened with the paper clip. You have to give them up. I want the notes in the paper clip when you give them up to be counted.

Put one note into your World/Country's [collection plate](https://www.google.com/search?site=&tbm=isch&source=hp&biw=1318&bih=740&q=collection+plate&oq=collection+plate&gs_l=img.3..0i19l5j0i30i19l2j0i5i30i19l3.1225.4257.0.4702.16.16.0.0.0.0.68.566.16.16.0....0...1.1.64.img..0.16.564.YPIH0f_Pgz0#imgrc=_), actually [collection bag](https://www.google.com/search?biw=1198&bih=673&tbm=isch&sa=1&q=church+collection+bags&oq=church+collection+bag&gs_l=img.3.0.0i19j0i8i30i19.43118.45068.0.50012.7.7.0.0.0.0.43.214.7.7.0....0...1.1.64.img..3.4.131.wnvRnWLA2rs)
 

# Walk in neighborhood homework

## The locations had to be on one walk

One point if Dr Bean thought the locations did not belong on one walk. (In some cases he gave the students "the benefit of the doubt.")

For example, one student had 4 slides of locations in 南苗 and then a slide of the 新東 Bridge, which is more than a kilometer away. No-one is going to walk one kilometer from 南苗 just to see the 新東 bridge.

I gave that student one point.

## "Every day is a fine day." Everything is interesting

For the tourist, everything in a different culture is interesting. What seems uninteresting to the locals is interesting to the visitors.

So, the best walks were not ones with pictures of famous, spectacular or exciting sites like 勝興車站, but ordinary ones with breakfast stores, post offices and libraries.

The ideas of walking is very important for the tourist. You don't have to walk as much as Sarah Marquis, but you need to walk to be close to the place. You cannot experience a place passing by at speed on a bus, motorcyle or bicycle. You need to walk, and to stand and look and think.

## Inline images

Some students were able to paste images directly in the message on elearning, eg YuWen.

I want everyone to paste images directly in the text rather than attaching a Powerpoint or Doc file next time.

# A trip down Memory Lane

## A walk that you took when you were a child.

## A trip down Memory Lane FAQ 1

> Can I use photos on google map or I have to take photos in person ?

You can use photos on google map. I don't know if you can post=20
them inline on elearning, which is required.

A clickable link to the picture on the Internet is OK.

## A trip down Memory Lane FAQ 2

> My route is start from my home and end at Yu-Ching Temple. Can I use temple as my final destination in route or it only should be a =
school ?

No, it has to be your elementary school. It's about the past, when you were an elementary school student,=20
not the present.

## A trip down Memory Lane FAQ 3

> I have 5 different place but they are in the same route, can I introduce =
each place on their own google map ?  For example, of my 5 places about childhood. It this ok ?

> Or those places should in the same route ? and google map only showed one=
 route?

No. Not 5 separate google maps. One google map.
They should be on the same route. Only one google map.

## A trip down Memory Lane FAQ 4

> Can the route continue on beyond the school to some other place?

I want them between your home and the school.  A park, temple and train station
BEYOND the school is not what I want.

## A trip down Memory Lane FAQ 5

> I use the google map but don't know how to mark these 5 places on one=
 route.

I think you can use the pin in the toolbar above and then click=20
on the place you want to mark.

## A trip down Memory Lane FAQ 6

> Can I upload a powerpoint file?

I want the pictures in the message itself, not in an attachment.

## A trip down Memory Lane FAQ 7

> I only had route without any introduction of five places, is it cor=
ect ?

I wasn't=20
very clear, and my message  isnt' a good example of what I want.

Just like the previous tourist walk, I want 5 pictures on one walk and 3 sentences about each picture on the walk.

Plus, this time, the google map.

## A trip down Memory Lane FAQ 8
