    Boyle: So, Jodi, What's up. Thanks for coming on the show.

    Ettenberg: Hi, Nathaniel. Thanks for having me.

    Boyle: Awesome. So where are you coming from right now.

    Ettenberg: Right now I am in Saigon in Vietnam, the southern, southern side of Vietnam, Ho Chi Minh City, as it is now known, but still called Saigon, while you're in the city. In the city, people still refer to it as such.

     And I've been here for a few months, since January. I went last year and just really fell in love with the food and how the culture really does center around food here. So I decided to make it my winter home again this year.

    Boyle: Amazing. OK. So I kind of gave a general overview of who you are. But I want you to tell us about yourself, and how you got started traveling.

    Ettenberg: Sure. I think it's common to assume that I was a corporate lawyer and I burnt out and I just fled and started traveling instead. Which isn't out of the .. makes sense, given the facts. But actually, what happened was that I had really wanted to do the Trans-Siberian trains as a month-long trip or a longer journey. And I saw a documentary about them when I was younger. And I just really, over the years, sort of kept that with me. And when I got a job offer to work in New York as a lawyer, I decided I would save up as much as I could during the .. time that I was working there. I'm from Montreal, so salaries were quite a bit higher in New York, and it seemed like a great way to get started on this dream I had.

      Um, when I had left 2008, my plan was really just to do one year of travel. I never quit to be a travel writer or to write about food. What I started my blog for was just to keep my mother updated about my life, to be honest. She has always been really supportive, but I thought that the visual component would be helpful as well in terms of what she could feel that she was a part of. And so I started it up. Legal Nomads made sense. I was with another lawyer, who was my opposing counsel, actually, on a deal. And we set off in April of 2008. We split ways pretty quickly because we had different desires of where we wanted to go and we're still really good friends. But I kept up with the site. She didn't love writing. And the rest really just fell into place over the years. It became more and more involved in food and how food is a great tool to learn about a place and wrote about it more. My readers seemed to jibe with that as well. And the site has grown and grown by itself over the last six years. April first will be six years. And it's got about a million people a year, according to my Wordpress annual report. Over a million for 2013.

    Boyle: Wow, that's really .. Congratulations.

      Ettenberg. Thank you. Yeh. I was surprised. I don't pay that much attention to the stats. And so when I got the annual .. It's a click here for your shiny annual report. And it's in the form of an infographic. And I clicked, and I was, "Wait. What?" (Laughs) This is lovely.
        
    Boyle: (Laughs) Cool. I think it's great that the Trans-Siberian is what inspired you to get out there and travel ..

    Boyle: So, I've shared a little about what you have done, but I want you to introduce yourself as a person. Um, take us back, Don. Where are you from? And where did you get your start in travel?

    George: So I grew up in Connecticut. And, er, traveled the way most people did in my generation, growing up, with parents, and school vacations, summer vacations. We would go down the coast to North Carolina, or up the coast to Nova Scotia. Or sometimes we had a cabin for the summers on Lake Ontario in New York. And so it was domestic travel, or as far as Canada. Um, so travel was part of my upbringing, but not very far-flung travel. And then the first trip abroad I ever made was the summer between my junior and senior year. Actually, the first trip abroad was the spring of my junior year in college, when my parents took me and my brother to London and Paris. And that was because they knew that I was going to live in Paris, the summer after my junior year in college on this summer work abroad program that I had. I went to Princeton, and Princeton had this thing called the Summer Work Abroad program for French majors. I was a French and English and American literature major, so I got a job in Paris as part of that program. My parents knew I was going to do that, so they took me there to introduce me under their wing to Paris and London before I went on my own. So that was my very, very first trip. The spring break of my junior year.

    Boyle: So what was it then that compelled you to go and take this summer work abroad. I mean, and then, obviously you would take this other trip with your parents to sort of acclimate yourself to the experience. But something must have been calling you.

    George: Well I loved French culture. I loved French literature. I had been studying French since I think, maybe sixth grade, though. It was just something that really appealed to me, I mean the notion of being able to live in .. And I was lucky enought to get an internship in Paris for the summer. So the notion of being able to live in Paris and sort of follow my literary heros, like Hemingway and Fitzgerald, and um, do the expat life for a summer in Paris was really, really intoxicating and seductive. And so that's why I applied for it. Um, i just wanted to see what would happen when I got out of my element in that incredibly seductive culture, what would happen.

    Boyle: Yes, you know, I always say this on the show, for anybody who may or may not be curious or might not have that drive or that motivation to pull .. to go abroad to experience what it's like to be in a new country, but to let a pre-existing interest pull you into a larger world, right? Because in your case, you were letting writing and these stories that you had already heard, these legends of Fitzgerald and Hemingway and stuff pull you into, into their world, so that you could find it. And then I'm guessing that what you found wasn't quite exactly what was in the story, but something wholly fascinating and unique to your own experience.

    George: Yes, absolutely. And I agree. I always tell about the passion point, that you should look for your passion point, and the world, and follow it, and .. Um, for me it was Hemingway, Fitzgerald and also all these French writers I was really .. Baudelaire and Rimbaud. I was immersed in French literature, typically, Wow and I just want to be where that was created. And so, yes, I went to Paris and, uh, um, fell in love over and over and over again. It was just magical on all sorts of levels. I lived with a French family as part of my internship. Um, that was great because they didn't speak any English and so I really had to immediately use my fumbling French to get along. And, and we'd have dinner together. We'd have breakfast together. I'd see them when I came home. And I had to chat. I had to make do in this foreign language. So that was really exciting and great. And, um, I just felt myself growing and growing and growing and encountering so many new situations on so many levels. Meeting new people. It was like the world blossomed under my feet. Everything seemed new and exciting and amazing and .. I did end up following Baudelaire and following Hemingway and following Fitzgerald and sort of checking their tracks and footsteps. But, um, more and more it was just the Paris of Don George that came to life for me. That was so extraordinary, the friendships I made, the discoveries I made, walking home late at night through the Parisian streets, or walking by the .. under the plane trees by the Seine, or going into Notre Dame. I mean, one, one magical moment after another. So it really changed my life.

    Boyle: Paris can be such a venue for those, those small magical things. I mean, that's why it inspired you, that's why it inspired them, that's why Midnight in Paris is a movie. All these amazing things. Because you can just walk around the corner and run into the thing that .. In a way, it's cities are so artfully constructed and they know it. And they've really held onto that. Um, because that's waiting for you. It's almost a timeless opportunity.

    George: It is. You walk down the streets in Paris surrounded by this incredibly elegant monumental architecture. And in a sense, you're in a museum and in a sense, you're in this vast work of art that belongs in a museum. And then you're .. people are museum pieces of themselves. Women, there's some incredible, incredibly stylishly dressed. And the wafting of their perfume as they walk past. And the way they fling their scarf. A leisurely and insouciantly over their shoulders. And I just .. And there were so many little moments that I just went, Oh, my goodness. I'm falling head over heels here. And then I .. you'd walk into a .. walk into a place like Notre Dame and just feel the centuries, the sacred air of centuries of centuries of pilgrims coming to this revered place. And bringing all their hearts and souls and minds to it. And what they had felt was accumulated in the air as you walk in there. So you feel that. It's just the top layer. And it's so incredibly moving. And you think of the fervent passion that built that place. And, er, the blood that built that place. And what that to them is an accumulation of. And so I had so many moments like that where history and culture and beauty, dream, all sort of came together and coalesced and it was a very, very heady stew. A very heady cocktail that I drank that summer.
