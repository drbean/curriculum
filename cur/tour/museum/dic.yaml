    A green man is having a staring contest with a cow. A small woman is milking a small cow. In the distance, a farmer carries a tool with a curved blade for cutting grain. He meets an upside-down woman walking in front of her upside-down house. "Careful Tanya, or you'll fall." Is this a dream? Maybe. Or maybe artist Marc Chagall is mixing memories of his home in Russia with folktales he heard when he was little. He was living far from home in the big city of Paris, France when he painted this picture. Look at the big cow again. Did you notice that thin line connecting her eye to the eye of the man? Maybe Chagall connected them because he remembered how much the animals and people in his town relied on each other. Maybe all nature was important. Check out the tree the green man is holding, with clouds of seeds bursting out of it. Chagall said, Our old inner world is reality. He meant that what we see in our imaginations can be as important as what we see with our eyes. How would you paint your feelings about your hometown?

    [Music and piano teacher]
    
    Artist Henri Matisse painted this picture of his son's piano lesson. He said that Pierre looked like a captive, trapped indoors. How does he show us that? Well, look at Pierre's serious face, half-hidden by a dark shadow. On the piano sits a golden candle. It's all burnt down, as if Pierre has been practicing for hours. And Matisse uses a lot of gray, not a very fun color. Next to Pierre, there's an open window with a swirling balcony. And outside it, that big triangle of fresh green grass seems to say, Come out and play. But poor Pierre must sit at the piano and practice. Instead of listening to the birds chirping, he has to concentrate on the beat of the triangular metronome on the piano. It ticks like a clock to keep time. Just behind Pierre is a blank-faced woman sitting very straight on a high stool. Who is she? His mother? A strict piano teacher? Perhaps she is just in his imagination. Or maybe she is a painting hanging on the wall. Did you notice another figure here in the bottom corner at the left? That's probably a statue made by his father. I bet Pierre's too busy focusing on his lesson to even notice it.

    Take a few steps back from this painting so you can see the whole thing. Now imagine jumping into the scene. You're trudging through the deep, dark jungle. Carefully, you part the tall ferns in the center. Aaargh! Lions. One of them with fierce yellow eyes is staring right at you. Quick! Roar back at him!

    In the jungle, you meet all sorts of beasts. Can you find one that might sound like this?
    
    "Caw, caw, caw"
    
    Yep. There's a bird perched high on a branch of the orange tree. And another up at the top on the left, flapping off with its yellow wings. How about this critter?

    "Bellow, bellow"

    Did you find the elephant behind the orange tree? Wave your trunk and bellow back at him. Okay, what else would you find in a jungle? How about a young woman relaxing on a velvet sofa? Whoa! Wait a minute. There's something strange about this place. That's because you've entered into a dream. "The Dream" is what the artist, Henri Rousseau called his painting. He wrote this poem to go with it.

    Having fallen into a gentle sleep,
    Yadwigha in a dream,
    Heard the sounds of a musette,
    Played by a benevolent musician.
    While the moon shone down,
    Upon the flowers, the green trees,
    The wild serpents listened,
    To the instrument's merry tunes.

    Yadwigha is the lady on the couch. But can you find the musician? Look closely. He's wearing a striped skirt. Watch out for the wild serpent. He's toward the bottom. An orange snake slithering through the grass. Rousseau never actually went to the jungle. In fact he never traveled far from his home in Paris. He got ideas for paintings like this one from visiting zoos, city gardens, and museums. And from his dreamy imagination.

    Number 1. Welcome.

    Welcome to the Vasa Museum, the world's most visited maritime museum. It's a summer day in Stockholm in the year 1628, and the new ship Vasa departs on her maiden voyage. One thousand oak trees, thousands of men, and three years' hard labor have created this pearl of the Swedish fleet. But then something happened. Which is the reason we are able to stand here today, and experience this magnificent and unique piece of history.. A light gust of wind, and then ..

    Hi. This audio guide leads you through Vasa's story. You'll hear theories on why the ship sank, how it was raised, a little Swedish history and much more. The listening stations are numbered and you can choose in which order you would like to visit the 15 stations. You can refer to the free map that is available at the information desk. Or you can look for the signs with the word, "MP3" in yellow text and an ear symbol as you explore the museum. If you'd like additional information about anything discussed in this guide, you can read the placards posted throughout the exhibition, or purchase more detailed information at the museum shop. You can also find additional information about accessibility and so on at the information desk. The restrooms are located to the left of the information desk.

    Number 2. Gustav Adolf.

    When the future king, Gustav Adolf was born in 1594, Sweden was a vast underpopulated and poor country on the fringes of Europe. And he was not in line for the throne. When he died in 1632 at the Battle of Lutzen, Sweden was one of the leading players on the European stage and Gustav Adolf himself had attained an almost mystical status, which surrounds him to this day. With war and expansionism, he laid the foundation for the Swedish Age of Greatness. Gustav Adolf was the son of Duke Carl of Sodermanland, and grandson of Gustav Vasa. When Gustav Adolf was a young boy, his father took power after a long conflict with his nephew, Sigismund, who was at the time king of both Sweden and Poland. The dispute was centered around Swedish and Polish expansion plans which conflicted with each other, and on religion. Sigismund was Catholic and Sweden was officially Lutheran.

    The prince was raised to be a genuine Renaissance man. He was educated in both academic subjects, as well as war strategy. He spoke both Swedish and German fluently, and had a working knowledge of several other languages. He also became a persuasive speaker and writer, something of which he availed himself throughout his reign, in order to make the nobility, the parliament, and foreign princes follow his will. Here's an example of a letter he wrote to his brother-in-law, Georg Wilhelm, Brandenburg's prince regent, when Georg Wilhelm tried to keep Brandenburg neutral during the 30 Years' War:

      I will hear nothing about any neutrality. His Highness must be friend or foe. When I reach the border, he must declare himself warm or cold. This is a battle between God and the Devil. If his Highness wishes to be on the side of God, then he must side with me. Would he prefer to be with the Devil, so must he fight against me.

      Gustav Adolf had inherited a war with Denmark from his father, and he was immediately drawn into another with Russia. Gustav Adolf spent almost his entire reign at war with Russia, Denmark, Poland and eventually, even with Germany. War demanded most of the king's attention and he personally led the war from the front lines. As a result of which, he was repeatedly wounded in battle. However many of these wars would not have been possible without the cooperation of the royal chancellor, Axel Oxenstierna, a very competent administrator. It was through him that the machinery of the state would be reorganized. The country's immense natural resources of land, copper, iron and timber could be more efficiently managed in order to finance the most modern army in Europe.

      When Gustav died at the age of 38, mortally wounded after leading a cavalry attack, he was known in Europe as one of the great generals of his time. He was also ruthlessly efficient at enforcing his will at the cost of great suffering. He is the only Swedish monarch who is remembered through a national flag day, the 6th of November, the anniversary of his death.

    Number 3. The shipwreck.

    How could a ship the size of Vasa sink so easily? It was after all built by the most experienced shipbuilders according to dimensions that the king himself had approved. The ship was to be used in war and was expected to withstand both enemy cannon and foul weather. It was a Sunday afternoon on the 10th of August when Vasa set off from the Palace Quay. Four sails were set and the gun ports on both gun decks had been opened in order to fire a salute and to show off the mighty ship's armament. The majority of Stockholm's 10,000 citizens lined the shore to see the magnificent ship on its way. The wind had previously been still, with only a light breeze taking the ship out of the harbor. Then suddenly a gust of wind caused Vasa to  heel over. The ship managed to right itself, but yet another gust sent it over again, this time so much that the water poured in through the open gun ports. The ship was overwhelmed by the weight of the water and sank. 

    It is believed approximately 150 people were on board the vessel at the time of the sinking. Out of this number, approximately 30 of them died. There were several reasons that the majority of those on board survived the catastrophe. Most were on the upper decks and in the rigging when the ship left port and thus avoided following the ship to the bottom. Another factor was that the sinking occured so close to shore that there were many people who could help those in distress.

    But the question remains, How could Vasa sink so easily and so quickly. Today it is believed that the ship was both incorrectly built and sailed. The ship was unstable owing to the center of gravity being too high. However, had the gun ports been closed, the ship may have righted itself and continued on its way.
