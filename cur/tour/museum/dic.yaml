    A green man is having a staring contest with a cow. A small woman is milking a small cow. In the distance, a farmer carries a tool with a curved blade for cutting grain. He meets an upside-down woman walking in front of her upside-down house. "Careful Tanya, or you'll fall." Is this a dream? Maybe. Or maybe artist Marc Chagall is mixing memories of his home in Russia with folktales he heard when he was little. He was living far from home in the big city of Paris, France when he painted this picture. Look at the big cow again. Did you notice that thin line connecting her eye to the eye of the man? Maybe Chagall connected them because he remembered how much the animals and people in his town relied on each other. Maybe all nature was important. Check out the tree the green man is holding, with clouds of seeds bursting out of it. Chagall said, Our old inner world is reality. He meant that what we see in our imaginations can be as important as what we see with our eyes. How would you paint your feelings about your hometown?

    [Music and piano teacher]
    
    Artist Henri Matisse painted this picture of his son's piano lesson. He said that Pierre looked like a captive, trapped indoors. How does he show us that? Well, look at Pierre's serious face, half-hidden by a dark shadow. On the piano sits a golden candle. It's all burnt down, as if Pierre has been practicing for hours. And Matisse uses a lot of gray, not a very fun color. Next to Pierre, there's an open window with a swirling balcony. And outside it, that big triangle of fresh green grass seems to say, Come out and play. But poor Pierre must sit at the piano and practice. Instead of listening to the birds chirping, he has to concentrate on the beat of the triangular metronome on the piano. It ticks like a clock to keep time. Just behind Pierre is a blank-faced woman sitting very straight on a high stool. Who is she? His mother? A strict piano teacher? Perhaps she is just in his imagination. Or maybe she is a painting hanging on the wall. Did you notice another figure here in the bottom corner at the left? That's probably a statue made by his father. I bet Pierre's too busy focusing on his lesson to even notice it.

    Take a few steps back from this painting so you can see the whole thing. Now imagine jumping into the scene. You're trudging through the deep, dark jungle. Carefully, you part the tall ferns in the center. Aaargh! Lions. One of them with fierce yellow eyes is staring right at you. Quick! Roar back at him!

    In the jungle, you meet all sorts of beasts. Can you find one that might sound like this?
    
    "Caw, caw, caw"
    
    Yep. There's a bird perched high on a branch of the orange tree. And another up at the top on the left, flapping off with its yellow wings. How about this critter?

    "Bellow, bellow"

    Did you find the elephant behind the orange tree? Wave your trunk and bellow back at him. Okay, what else would you find in a jungle? How about a young woman relaxing on a velvet sofa? Whoa! Wait a minute. There's something strange about this place. That's because you've entered into a dream. "The Dream" is what the artist, Henri Rousseau called his painting. He wrote this poem to go with it.

    Having fallen into a gentle sleep,
    Yadwigha in a dream,
    Heard the sounds of a musette,
    Played by a benevolent musician.
    While the moon shone down,
    Upon the flowers, the green trees,
    The wild serpents listened,
    To the instrument's merry tunes.

    Yadwigha is the lady on the couch. But can you find the musician? Look closely. He's wearing a striped skirt. Watch out for the wild serpent. He's toward the bottom. An orange snake slithering through the grass. Rousseau never actually went to the jungle. In fact he never traveled far from his home in Paris. He got ideas for paintings like this one from visiting zoos, city gardens, and museums. And from his dreamy imagination.
