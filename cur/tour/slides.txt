## The unexamined trip is not worth traveling--Socrates

What should be your aim traveling?

To enjoy yourself, OK.

But also, to learn about your actions and thoughts
and OTHER actions and thoughts in OTHER cultures.

## Aim of course

- To get you to think like a traveler, and to be a good consumer and judge of travel documents.
- Help people to try out different ideas/ways of presenting about places.

# Accommodation

## Youth hostels in Taipei

# Dr Bean's walk from his bicycle to his weekend office at NUU

## The parking lot

1. The parking lot in B1 in the 行政 building. This is where they keep students who fail exams. The students have to pedal exercise bicycles to generate electricity.

## The basketball courts

This photo was taken at 10am on Sunday morning. In 6 hours time, the court will be completely filled with players, competing to get a ball through a hoop. What a contrast with the classrooms where students have no wish to compete to show their English speaking prowess.

## 7-11

7-11 was closed over the vacation. A glass wall was placed in front of the entrance. Perhaps it is windy and cold in winter. It looks like something that will be broken sooner or later.

## The architecture department

The building occupied by the architecture profs is not architecturally distinguished. Perhaps the profs are good at talking about architecture, but not good at doing architecture. As GB Shaw said, "Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.

## No Smoking signs at passageway between architecture department and lecture hall building.

Three no-smoking signs indicate smoking is forbidden in this place. Perhaps the architecture profs are bothered by the smoke. Still, there are cigarette butts on the ground, probably not visible in this photo.

## First floor of lecture hall building

Some of the lecture halls are still used every period some days, even after the opening of the 八甲 campus. On Sundays, student groups, and studious students occupy the rooms. Dr Bean can also be found there.
