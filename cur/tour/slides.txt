## The unexamined trip is not worth traveling--Socrates

What should be your aim traveling?

To enjoy yourself, OK.

But also, to learn about your actions and thoughts
and OTHER actions and thoughts in OTHER cultures.

## Aim of course

- To get you to think like a traveler, and to be a good consumer and judge of travel documents.
- Help people to try out different ideas/ways of presenting about places.

# Accommodation

## Youth hostels in Taipei

# Dr Bean's walk from his bicycle to his weekend office at NUU

## The parking lot

1. The parking lot in B1 in the 行政 building. This is where they keep students who fail exams. The students have to pedal exercise bicycles to generate electricity.

## The basketball courts

This photo was taken at 10am on Sunday morning. In 6 hours time, the court will be completely filled with players, competing to get a ball through a hoop. What a contrast with the classrooms where students have no wish to compete to show their English speaking prowess.

## 7-11

7-11 was closed over the vacation. A glass wall was placed in front of the entrance. Perhaps it is windy and cold in winter. It looks like something that will be broken sooner or later.

## The architecture department

The building occupied by the architecture profs is not architecturally distinguished. Perhaps the profs are good at talking about architecture, but not good at doing architecture. As GB Shaw said, "Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach.

![Architecture department](/home/drbean/圖片/044.JPG)

## No Smoking signs at passageway between architecture department and lecture hall building.

Three no-smoking signs indicate smoking is forbidden in this place. Perhaps the architecture profs are bothered by the smoke. Still, there are cigarette butts on the ground, probably not visible in this photo.

![No smoking signs](/home/drbean/圖片/045.JPG)

## First floor of lecture hall building

Some of the lecture halls are still used every period some days, even after the opening of the 八甲 campus. On Sundays, student groups, and studious students occupy the rooms. Dr Bean can also be found there.

# Exam

## Week 5

4 tour groups of 15 tourists in Front Right, Front Left, Back Right, Back Left,

Wear comfortable shoes, because you will be standing for 2 hours.

One person (a tour guide) tells the others about his/her walk. The places on the walk must be connected. It must be possible to walk from one place to all the other places.

He/she leaves the tour group, moves clockwise to join the next group.

The others decide what grade to give her, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 beans. Each group has only 60 beans to award the 15 tour guides.

The group will decide the grade on the basis of the interest of the talk and her/his performance as a tour guide.

## Managing the beans

After the tourist guide leaves, the tourists decide how much to "tip" her/him by voting for 2, 3, 4, or 5. The points with the most votes wins, ie are the points awarded. The next tour guide takes the beans and gives the beans to that tour guide when she joins him/her in the next tour group.

The person who performs the vote is the person who will be the tour guide next time.

## Deciding how many beans {.allowframebreaks}

Criteria

1. Could you understand what he/she said?
2. Was what they said interesting?
3. Were they well prepared to be a tour guide?
4. Did they speak about 5 places connected by a walk?
5. Did they say 3 things about each place?
6. How long did they speak?
7. What was the reaction of the other tourists?
8. Did tourists ask questions?

## Distribution of 3-, 4-, and 5-bean tips {.allowframebreaks}

Try to give equal numbers of 3, 4 and 5 beans.

- 2 beans if they stand up, but don't say anything.
- 3 beans if you can't understand and it isn't interesting and they don't speak very long.
- 4 beans if you think they did a good job and you understood what they said.
- 5 beans if you wished you could do as well as they did, because they satisfied all the 8 criteria.

## Responsibilities {.allowframebreaks}

For example, in the first round in the Front Right tour group,

1. *Ivy* will be the tour guide.
2. After, she leaves for the Back Right group. *Andy* carries out the vote, declares the beans to be awarded to Ivy.
3. Andy gives them to *Louis*, who is the tour guide in the second round.
4. When Louis leaves for the Back Right group, he gives the beans to Ivy.

## Bean economy {.allowframebreaks}

Each tourist group of 15 has 60 beans, in the form of 32 one-bean notes and 14 two-bean notes, good for an average of 4 beans for each tourist guide.

At the start, if you give everyone 5 beans, there will be no beans for the last tour guides.

On the other hand, if you give everyone 3 beans at the start, there will be many beans left over at the end of the activity, which no one can get. (5 beans is the maximum you can get.)

Try to keep a track of how many 3-, 4- and 5-bean tips you are giving. This can only be a rough estimate. Don't worry about that.

Dr Bean will ask you after the -2 C tour guides and -4 C tour guides have got their tips.

## Exam debriefing

I think it went well.

I want to do something similar in Weeks 9, 13 and 18

Week 9 will probably be describing some places you walked to in your childhood. eg school, and the places you passed on the way.

Uta gave me beans she collected from seniors and other students. She said she has 3 more beans than the total grades recorded. Please speak up if your name is not on this list and you gave her beans.

# Walk in neighborhood homework

## The locations had to be on one walk

One point if Dr Bean thought the locations did not belong on one walk. (In some cases he gave the students "the benefit of the doubt.")

For example, one student had 4 slides of locations in 南苗 and then a slide of the 新東 Bridge, which is more than a kilometer away. No-one is going to walk one kilometer from 南苗 just to see the 新東 bridge.

I gave that student one point.

## "Every day is a fine day." Everything is interesting

For the tourist, everything in a different culture is interesting. What seems uninteresting to the locals is interesting to the visitors.

So, the best walks were not ones with pictures of famous, spectacular or exciting sites like 勝興車站, but ordinary ones with breakfast stores, post offices and libraries.

The ideas of walking is very important for the tourist. You don't have to walk as much as Sarah Marquis, but you need to walk to be close to the place. You cannot experience a place passing by at speed on a bus, motorcyle or bicycle. You need to walk, and to stand and look and think.

## Inline images

Some students were able to paste images directly in the message on elearning, eg YuWen.

I want everyone to paste images directly in the text rather than attaching a Powerpoint or Doc file next time.
