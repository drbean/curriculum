The idea of an academic vocabulary has a long history in teaching English for academic or _____(1) purposes. Indeed, academic vocabulary is used to refer to _____(2) which are reasonably frequent in a wide _____(3) of academic genres but are relatively uncommon in other kinds of _____(4).  The purpose of many university-level _____(5) is to help students develop control over such vocabulary and teachers see it as an important part of their _____(6). Attempts have been made to assemble lists of key terms to guide materials writers and help students plan their learning more efficiently. Early ESP materials, for example, _____(7) to _____(8) and present forms with a high frequency in scientific and _____(9) writing;  and _____(10) effort has been devoted to investigating the vocabulary needed for academic study. Such _____(11) is usually based on the _____(12) that learners are _____(13) to build a repertoire of specialized academic words in addition to their existing basic or general service vocabulary, and this repertoire building is often seen as the purpose of developing university vocabulary.

Vocabulary is typically seen as falling into three main groups:
<br>
1. High frequency words such as those included in West's General Service List of the most widely useful 2,000-word families in English, covering about 80% of words in most _____(14).
<br>
2. An academic vocabulary of words which are reasonably frequent in academic writing and comprise some 8%-10% of running words in academic _____(15).
<br>
3. A _____(16) vocabulary which differs by subject and covers up to 5% of _____(17).

ESL/EFL students are said to find an academic vocabulary a particularly challenging _____(18) of their learning. This _____(19) of their learning is challenging because, although _____(20) vocabulary is central to students' specialized _____(21) , general academic vocabulary serves a largely supportive _____(22) and the words are "not likely to be explained by the content teacher". Many of these words also _____(23) too infrequently to allow incidental learning, encouraging _____(24) and teachers to develop vocabulary lists for directly teaching these terms.
