# Dr Bean's experience

## Dr Bean's experience being hit by bouncers in bars in northern Australia at the age of 30

1. I entered a bar to get a woman who was needed for a concert. As I was leaving, the bouncer kept pushing me from behind. I turned around and said to him, "Who are you?" This is rude. He hit me in the eyebrow, splitting my eyebrow.

2. I was sitting in the lounge section of the bar, which is more expensive, nicer than the ordinary section, but I didn't have any shoes on, which is not allowed. I could see the bouncer was not happy with me. I said to the people I was drinking with, "He's my friend." He grabbed me and pulled me out of the bar onto the street and hit me above the eye, splitting my eyebrow.
