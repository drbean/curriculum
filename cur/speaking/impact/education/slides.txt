## Your experience of school

- One teacher you liked and your reason
- One teacher you didn't like and your reason
- One subject you liked and your reason
- One subject you didn't like and your reason


## Dr Bean's experience of school

- He liked a teacher called Mr Stelzer, who taught mathematics, because he made the subject interesting and was enthusiastic. I think he took a personal interest in me.
- He didn't like another math teacher, because the teacher wasn't enthusiastic and the mathematics he was teaching that year wasn't interesting. 'If you get a loan from the bank for $5,000 and interest is 5% per year, how much interest will you pay over 5 years?'

- He liked mathematics, because it was exciting being able to solve problems, and he did well in it.
- He didn't like English or French. The reason he didn't like English was Shakespeare and the other books we read weren't interesting. He didn't like French, because it seemed like there was no content in it. It didn't seem like he was learning anything valuable.

## Your evaluation of teachers

- What do you think of teachers?
- Would you like to be a teacher?

## Dr Bean's evaluation of teachers

- At school, Dr Bean didn't think highly of teachers. They didn't speak to you personally, but to nobody in particular. They talked down to you. In high school they called me, Matheson, but I had to call my math teacher Mr Stelzer, even though I called him Stelzer with other students.
- Dr Bean had no wish to become a teacher. But in Japan, he became very interested in learning languages, and he started teaching to make a living. He found teaching English very interesting. Even now, though, he is not proud to be a teacher.

Then say what decision the hospital should make.
