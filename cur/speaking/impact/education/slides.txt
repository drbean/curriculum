## Your experience of school

- One teacher you liked/didn't like and your reason
- One subject you liked/didn't like and your reason
- One thing that motivated/de-motivated you at school
- One change that should be made in schools


## Dr Bean's experience of school

- He liked a teacher called Mr Stelzer, who taught mathematics, because he made the subject interesting and was enthusiastic. I think he took a personal interest in me.
- He didn't like another math teacher, because the teacher wasn't enthusiastic and the mathematics he was teaching that year wasn't interesting. 'If you get a loan from the bank for $5,000 and interest is 5% per year, how much interest will you pay over 5 years?'

- He liked mathematics, because it was exciting being able to solve problems, and he did well in it.
- He didn't like English or French. The reason he didn't like English was Shakespeare and the other books we read weren't interesting. He didn't like French, because it seemed like there was no content in it. It didn't seem like he was learning anything valuable.

## Your evaluation of teachers

- What do you think of teachers?
- Would you like to be a teacher?

## Dr Bean's evaluation of teachers

- At school, Dr Bean didn't think highly of teachers. They didn't speak to you personally, but to nobody in particular. They talked down to you. In high school they called me, Matheson, but I had to call my math teacher Mr Stelzer, even though I called him Stelzer with other students.
- Dr Bean had no wish to become a teacher. But in Japan, he became very interested in learning languages, and he started teaching to make a living. He found teaching English very interesting. Even now, though, he is not proud to be a teacher.

## Points of view--Tomoko and JinSook debate the education system as students

- Who's happy with the education system as it is and doesn't want change?  Who isn't happy with the education system as it is and wants it to change?
- Who probably gets higher scores in exams?
- Who would probably be the more interesting teacher?
- Who is teacher-centered? Who is student-centered?

## Points of view--What do you think about the Tomoko and JinSook debate on the education system

Dr Bean doesn't know. He likes the new way (or Western way?) better than the old way (or Eastern way?), but he is afraid the new way
[throws the baby out with the bath water ](http://www.google.com.tw/search?q=%22throw+the+baby+out+with+the+bath+water%22&num=100&gws_rd=ssl&tbm=isch&tbo=u&source=univ&sa=X)

He agrees with JinSook but is afraid Tomoko is right.

# Personalization

## What question about education do you want your partner to ask you in the exam?

Write the question you will answer in the middle of the first piece of paper

For example,

Write down the questions (the _questions_, not the _answers_) your partners ask you on the second piece of paper.

# Affirmative action

## Points of view--Mac, Samantha and Crystal on Affirmative Action

| Mac: I'm white, and white people treated black people very badly in the past. But now it's different. There are many black students on campus, so I don't think there needs to be any special treatment of them, or anyone, now. If you give them preference now, some prejudiced white people can continue to remain prejudiced. It makes race relations bad.
| Samantha: I'm Hispanic and I got in through affirmative action. But it may not have been because of my race. In affirmative action, they also include students from poor families, students who have mental and physical handicaps, and students who have helped the community. Perhaps I got in because of that.
| Crystal: I'm Asian-American and and I got in through affirmative action, but affirmative action hurt my chances of getting in. That's because 1 in 5 students here are Asian-American, but in the US only 1 in 20 are. The school doesn't want MORE students like me. However, I still think there are a lot of inequalities in the US. The school should let more disadvantaged students in.

## Points of view--Affirmative Action questions

- Who approves of affirmative action?
- Who doesn't approve of affirmative action?
- Who was probably not admitted through affirmative action?
- Who is NOT a member of a minority?
