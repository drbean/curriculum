## Are the police doing a good job to stop crime

What do you think?

# Punishment

## The death penalty

The US is the only industrially-developed country, along with Japan, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan, that still has the death penalty, according to: [Capital punishment in the United States - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_the_United_States)

## Points of view on the death penalty

- Who agrees/disagrees with capital punishment?
- What point is argued by one, but NOT both, Francesca and Abena?
	- Does the existence of a death penalty reduce the number of murders that take place?
	- Is it expensive dealing with murderers?
- Abena says the death penalty shouldn't exist because it tells every member of society:
	- that he/she may be killed next
	- that it is OK to kill people to solve problems.
