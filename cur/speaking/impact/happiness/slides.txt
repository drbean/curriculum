# Points of view

## Tomoko and Nazim discuss being happy

* Tomoko wish she could live forever on a tropical island, lie on the beach, eat exotic food and dance all night. Her idea of happiness is being surrounded by beautiful things and having a good time.
* Nazim says he wouldn't be satisfied by that. He would feel he was wasting his life. He needs to feel he is creating or improving things.
* Tomoko says Nazim could paint pictures, build a dream house and raise a family on a tropical island. She says you don't have to sit in an office to find a purpose in life.
* Nazim says he respects those ways of living, but thinks they are too concerned with the immediate world around us. He wants to do something to improve society. That's what makes him happy.
