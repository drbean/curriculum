# Dr Bean and others' political views

## Dr Bean and Yoko

- He has little interest in political affairs, but he interested in talking about political ideologies.
- She is interested in elections in Japan and is radical, voting for communist candidates and opposition parties and against the government party in power.

## Dr Bean's mother and father

- Dr Bean's father came from a middle-class family and he supported moderate right-wing candidates. In the US, he would have voted for the Republican Party.
- Dr Bean's mother came from a working-class family and she supported moderate left-wing candidates. In the US, she would have voted for the Democratic Party.

## Steve Hoover and his wife

- Steve (I think) has good things to say about the DPP, despite Chen SuiBian.
- Steve's wife is Hakka, and apparently supports the KMT, judging from what he has said to me.

Ask him.

The Hakka have traditionally supported the KMT, haven't they?

They have opposed Taiwanese independence movements for hundreds of years, haven't they?

## Left-wing--Right-wing

Left-wing politics - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing
Right-wing politics - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing

## Your experience

Tell your group your experience of other people's political views

Eg, your family, or friends, or famous figures

## Politics and other topics to avoid on first meetings

According to, [Mastering the Art of Small Talk ](http://www.ou.edu/class/bc2813/ConversationTips/MasteringSmallTalk.htm):

When you first meet a person, avoid these unpleasant, overly
personal, or highly controversial issues because they can quickly
degenerate into depressing conversations or arguments:

- Sex, politics, and religion.
- Personal, health, money, or family problems.
- Divorce or death.
- Gory crimes and decaying moral values of Western civilization.
- Layoffs and gloomy economic predictions.
- Terrorism, war, pestilence, and famine.
- Emotionally charged issues such as abortion, welfare, or capital
punishment.

# Points of view

## Annan, Jin-Sook argue about politics {.allowframebreaks}

1. Jin-sook says, "It's a good idea to have extremists to keep moderates on their toes." Does she mean:

- Extremists can be good for a society to have
- Extremists should be eliminated and replaced with moderates

2. "To keep a person on his/her toes" is an idiom from boxing, a martial art. In this situation, it means to

- force moderates into a bad position, where they cannot respond to changes
- make moderates active, aware and responsive, ready to react to changes

3. Who is the idealist? Who is the realist? What makes you think so?

- Annan, Jin-Sook
- Jin-Sook, Annan

4. Who is idealistic about extremism?

- Annan
- Jin-Sook

# Being critical

## Let's criticize communism {.allowframebreaks}

Dr Bean thinks communism may be good in theory, but it's bad in practice.

It's good to help the 'proletariat' (= the working class) but government control of the economy does not work. It's better to let people have free markets. 

In markets, people have more information about their needs, and can make better decisions than government bureaucrats.

Government bureaucrats probably think they know best, and are probably trying to help. But the economy is too complicated to be controlled successfully.

## Let's criticize capitalism {.allowframebreaks}

Dr Bean thinks it's OK to be a capitalist, but he isn't a capitalist.

Money may be necessary, but the interesting and important things in life are not work and making money. It's not good to have lots of money.

People should try to do things that DON'T make money.

# A discussion of different political philosophies

## Capitalism and socialism/communism {.allowframebreaks}

  	- Communists: 1-1, 2-1, 3-1, 4-1
