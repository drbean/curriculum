    Sara: Two girls were talking. And then a cute guy came by. And then, he was talking. But one girl pretended that she was, wasn't smart.

    Well, I think that intelligence is sexy in a woman. And, um, changing yourself is, um, definitely wrong. I do have, like, many friends who do that all the time. But it is really easy to get a date. It is. But the problem is that they date that person and they realize that it was the wrong man. And they finally just break up. And, um, and it's because they pretended they were a different person. If you want the right man, you have to be yourself.

    Cleaned-up version

    In my opinion, intelligence is sexy in a woman. Changing yourself is definitely wrong, I would say. I have female friends who do that all the time, trying not to act intelligent. When you do that, it maybe really easy to get a date. But the problem is, they date that person for a while and eventually they realize it was the wrong man. And finally they break up because they pretended they were a different person. If you want the right man, you have to be yourself.

    Hi. This is Richard. Let's look at Unit 2. Traffic Jam. In Unit 2, the focus is on traffic, what happens when there are too many vehicles on the road. In big cities all over the world--Seoul, Taipei, Tokyo, Shanghai, New York, London, Sao Paolo--there is a flood of cars, trucks, buses on the streets. The result is a big mess, a big jam.

    There are some cities such as Singapore and London that have done some very innovative things to try to solve the traffic problem. Unfortunately, many cities have not done anything. Here are some very interesting questions that come out of this unit.

    What are some solutions to traffic problems? What can we do? Is there anything we can do? Why do people use cars? Are there alternative forms of transportation to driving cars? Are there anything that governments can do to solve these problems?

    Now when you start teaching this unit, there are some things that you might want to think about before you begin. A lot of people think that owning a car and driving a car is a status symbol, that is, it shows that they have money, that they are important people. And they would really hate to give up driving a car.

    And when it comes right down to it, people maybe don't care so much about the environment as they should, when they have a car. They think it's very convenient, and it takes them to where they want to go.

    Ah, some difficult issues to face in this, but with the cost of oil going up and up and up, this is an important issue. I hope your students enjoy it.

    Scott: Well, the situation is that we have two people working in a company abroad. And, uh, one of them feels that it's important to learn the local language. And the other one thinks that, because the company, uh, works, uh, speaks in English, that it is OK not to learn the language. And, uh the tensions around that issue.

    I think that if you go anywhere to live for an extended period of time, you need to make the effort to learn that local language. I think it shows a lot about your willingness to learn about the culture, and I pretty much can guarantee that if you take the time to learn that language, the people around you, whether or not they speak English or not, will respect you more. That has been my experience in living in Japan, so I would urge all people to do that. If you've lived in a place for only one year or something like that, there's no way you can help it, but after four years or so, there's no excuse not to try.

    Richard Day: Aloha. This is Richard. I'd like to talk to you about Unit 11, An International Relationship. Akane is in Paris. She's writing an email to her best friend, Mari, who is in Japan. Akane is at a college in Paris and she's almost finished. But there's a problem. She has a boyfriend, Lukus. He lives in Finland. She really doesn't like Finland. When she's been there, she complained about it. She thought it was not a nice place to live. And the language was hard. Very difficult.

    Lukus doesn't want to live in Japan. Aha, here's a problem. And also, there's the parents. You know, her parents aren't really happy about her living in Europe any more. She's been there and she, she .. they want her to come back.

    What should she do? Aha, this is a great question. It involves what it takes to make an international relationship successful. Then it also looks at the bigger question, How about any relationship? How about any sort of situation between a man and a woman? What should we do? Very, very difficult. Um, what should Akane do? She doesn't want to break up with him, with, with Lukus. But they don't have a place to live.

    Now when you teach this unit, you might want to keep in mind that not all of your students have really given any thought of living abroad, much less falling in love with someone from another country. In addition, students might be reluctant to share their ideas about possible problems in a relationship, even one in their own country.

    Gillian: Okay. this situation is about a decision a college student, a young woman, has to make as to whether to follow her boyfriend to Finland after university, or to go her own way.
        Well, what I think is that, um, all young people, but I would say particularly women, um, given the role, the idea that a woman has to find a man--that is often an idea in our society--given that, I think women particularly, but all young people should get experience, life experience. So I would recommend anyone graduating from college, um, travel a little, have work experience in different places, even take on different jobs. I would not recommend that people rush into a committed relationship, or even get married that young. But it depends on the person, of course.

        Um, I have a friend who had a very close intimate relationship with her boyfriend at university. When graduation came around, they decided to go different ways, but they kept in touch. My friend went to the States, from England, for two years, met many different people, had different experiences. At the end of two years, met up with her boyfriend again, and then they decided, yep, they'd had experiences, they wanted to be together. Don't rush things.

    Steve: The situation is that there are two guys. It sounds like they are college students. And they are talking together. And, one of the guys is unhappy, because someone, he heard from somebody, that there's a rumor that he, he's gay. And he said, it's not true. 

    Well I think that, um, unfortunately, people are people. No matter where you are, whatever country you're in, someone will gossip about somebody. I don't know why it happens, but it, it does. About this situation, I had a similar situation happen to me, unfortunately. Um, in the early days of computers, um, the Internet was just coming in, and I'd left my Internet open without closing it, and I, I'd forgotten to do that. I didn't realize at the time. And, um, someone sent a friend of mine an email saying that I wanted to go out with him.

    And, uh, he came to me a few days later and said, "Steve, I'm not like that!" And I said, "What do you mean?" I had no idea what he was talking about. And, uh, he didn't tell me, and I thought--I was confused! And then a day later or two days later, he came up to me and he confessed what he, what was, that I'd sent him an email.  And I said, no, I hadn't! And, basically, to be honest, he still didn't believe me.

    Todd: The situation is, the government has a plan to control the population. Their idea is to make childless couples pay a fine and give that money to couples with children, because it costs quite a bit of money to raise children.

    This is a very interesting idea. Many countries have a population problem. Other countries don't have enough people. They have aging societies. So trying to regulate this seems like it might be a good idea.

    I am in favor of the government giving some money when children are born because children do cost so much money. And in developed countries there seems to be a problem with the aging society--not having enough children. Now in other countries there are too many children, but I'm not in favor of the government telling them that they must not have children. Advising, yes, but not telling them.

    So as far as fining childless couples, I think the government goes too far there. So I think the government has to strike the right balance to encourage those countries that need more children to have children to encourage the country that have, the countries that have too many children not to have children. But to, to make them pay fines for this, it's going overboard a bit.

    Derek: The situation is about changing times. In this case, whether or not to live with your significant other. like girlfriend or boyfriend, before marriage.

    Cohabitation, before marriage? Really, it's up to the individuals who are involved in the relationship. Obviously, society, and ultimately parents, do have an opinion about such issues. But still it's up to those two who want, the two people who want to take their relationship to the next step, but maybe do not feel that they're ready for that larger commitment. So really it's another stage of the relationship--cohabitation.  The parents may have dissatisfaction, but they need to understand that their children are growing up in an era different from their own, that the value systems have changed. And so for two people to get together, to live together before marriage, could open the doors for them to explore their relationships better and to ultimately avoid making a mistake in a, especially in societies where the divorce rates are at fifty percent.

  - speaking

    Junko: Hello, this is Junko. I'd like to talk about Unit 16, Size discrimination. In this unit, a woman who is overweight decides to accept her body. Alicia used to hate her body. She was always on a diet and afraid to talk to guys. However, one day she attended a meeting held by an organization that fights size discrimination. And since that time, she has been confident about herself. She has accepted her body and she's feeling happy.

    A lot of people worry about being overweight. How much does our weight affect our health and happiness? Should it? There's some questions raised: Do you feel people are too worried about their weight? Do you think too many people are on diets? Is being slim always good? Another issue is that, Is there such a thing as size discrimination in your country? People who are over, overweight are like made fun of, or that kind of thing? How about at school? How about at work? And how do people feel about it? Is looking good always important? Or are other good qualities more important than looks or size?

    Here's some things to keep in mind. This is a rather sensitive issue. Many students, especially girls, feel they are overweight, even if they are not. And sometimes it's really amazing, you know, surprising, that some girls who are rather slim feel that they are overweight. Sometimes I can't believe that they feel that way. But, you know, these students, these students, and those who are really overweight might feel uncomfortable talking about this topic. 

    'Kay? Another thing to keep in mind is that teachers and students might not feel comfortable using the word, "fat." So in that case, I advise you to use "heavy," or "overweight." 'Kay. I hope your students get a lot out of this unit.

    Andrea: After dieting on and off for quite some time, the young woman decides that she's going to be satisfied with her physical appearance, and accept that being healthy is the way to be, no matter what her body looks like.

    As much as we're told that beauty is having this kind of hair style or wearing these kind of clothes, I, I fully believe that the real root of beauty lies within self-confidence. And that once you have that, your, your general physical appearance is going to match that psychological appearance that you have. And if you really think about it, the most beautiful people you know are those people that kind of exude self-confidence and believe in themselves.

    And for this reason I think that the young woman in this scenario is going to, even though she may not be changing, she will be, people will see her in a different light because she believes a different thing about the, herself. And that's that she is, she is who she is, and she's not dissatisfied with that. She's OK with that. And I think that's the secret to success.

  - Who will help refugees?
  - speaking
  - all
  - |+
    Richard: Aloha. this is Richard. Let's look at Unit 17, Who will help them? The 'them' in the title of this unit means refugees. Specifically, it begins with the concern over how to help refugees. A young man, a university student has just heard an announcement that his country's prime minister is planning to give a large amount of money to help African refugees.

    Shen is concerned that they don't need their help. He wonders why his country should give a lot of money to help starving, homeless refugees in Africa. He believes that the United Nations should help. And maybe other countries in Africa should help. He's concerned that the money will go to other people when there are problems in his own country.

    The issue then, focuses initially on who should help refugees. Should the government of one country help another country's refugees? The broader issue is how might some of our serious problems in the world be addressed. Whose responsibility are these problems?

    Now when you teach this issue, you might consider that your students might have a little awareness. They might not know much about the plight of refugees throughout the world. Some students might not even understand that a number of different events, not only natural disasters, such as tsunami, can cause people to become refugees.

    Justin: The issue here is, Should governments of rich countries spend lots of money helping people in poor countries. Or should they focus on problems inside their own countries.
    
     I think the issue here is really, ah, what is the alternative to helping? Ah, yes we have to look after ourselves, we have to look after our family, we have to look after our friends. If we're a government, we have to look after our people. But let's just think about this. Imagine you have a choice. Your choice is, you can help someone or you can refuse to help someone. Can you sleep at night having made the, the choice not to help them? I think not. And I think governments are really just an extension of individuals. And I think governments also need to sleep well at night. Therefore, I think, although we would like to keep all the money to help, to help ourselves, I think it's very important to be kind, generous, and to, to help others, just as perhaps one day we will need help, too.

    Mei: The issue is the pros and cons of introduced marriage and love marriage.

    I think introduced marriage is a safe way to meet someone. It's also a good way to meet someone. Um, when I was young I thought it's very unromantic. But now I think it's a good idea because I have a friend who was introduced to her husband from her parents and she didn't know him at all. But, um, they married right away and they've been married for almost ten years and they look very happy. They have two children, she, she's, she has many hobbies that her husband supports and they, I feel, I think that they love each other, too. And that marriage is also good but there's no guarantee that you can be in love forever, and it doesn't mean that if you, if you love each other, you can be really happy to be together, so I think, I still think a love marriage is good, but introduced marriage is also good.

    I think that the way people dress is an expression of who they are. And I think that the students want to know who their teachers are. Some of the subjects in high school are not so interesting, but I think if you know the teacher well, it would help the students, um, become more interested in that subject

    Richard Day: Aloha. This is Richard. I'm going to look at Unit 20, A Mother's Story. I love the way this story begins. Let me read it to you. "My heart jumped with joy when he was dead. I knew then, when the electricity was sent into that man's body, that I would finally have peace." Thlat's a real gripping beginning. And this takes us into a mother's story about her son, who was killed needlessly, senselessly, in a robbery. She wants the murderer, the robber, to die for his crime. Ooh, this is a very powerful story. And it raises a number of very, very deep and emotional questions. Is capital punishment an appropriate punishment for murder? Should our government kill people? Another issue that's really important is one of the justifications that we hear for capital punishment, that capital punishment prevents people from killing other people. Is this true? Another good issue is, Is the death penalty ever the right sentence? What is someone kills a policeman who is trying to prevent a robbery? Should that person be killed by the state? Some very, very difficult questions. Sometimes, they're very hard to answer.

    Now I would suggest that when you teach this, you keep in mind that it is an emotional issue. It can provoke strong feelings. And also discussions of death penalty often get into religion, and culture. Good luck with this very interesting unit.
    
    Scott: The situation is that a mother whose child was murdered is talking about the death penalty. And the fact that she actually saw the man who killed her son die by the death penalty. And how that made her feel.

    Well, you see, the woman said that it made her feel better that she saw him die, but actually in my opinion, and also studies have shown, that even when families who have had that happen actually watched that they may in the short term feel good but the long term effects aren't good. You're not actually psychologically prepared to deal with that either. Um, so I don't approve of the death penalty.

    Ah, generally, I don't think that a life for a life makes sense. The state is just as barbaric if you do that. And then also from the psychological point of view of those who were' ah, done wrong by the killing, um, in the end, it doesn't make anyone feel good. So I don't agree with the mother's stance that watching someone be killed watching someone die, is a good thing.

    I am in favor of cosmetic surgery. I understand that parents are against cosmetic surgery because you're rejecting their DNA and it also seems like you're rejecting your parents. And changing the way you look like is not how you were naturally born and that would be heartbreaking for them. And in my country there were so many girls who had cosmetic surgery and it was quite natural. They just went to the clinic and one hour later they get big eyes and it was really beautiful. They looked so confident and really happy. So it was really, really popular. And first, it's the eyes, and then it's the nose, and other parts.

    I was at the airport to pick up my friend Sandra, who was visiting from Italy.

    Gustavo: Do you have everything?
    Sandra: Yes, I think so. But, I don't have any U.S.  dollars. Where can I change money? Can I do that here?
    Gustavo: You could, but I wouldn't recommend it. The exchange rate is really high and so are the fees. I'll take you to the bank tomorrow.

    The next day, I picked Sandra up from her hotel and we went to a branch nearby.

    Bank clerk: What can I do for you?
    Sandra: I'd like to exchange some currency and to get some U.S. dollars.
    Bank clerk: Okay, how much would you like?
    Sandra: How much is one Euro worth?
    Bank clerk: The current rate is one dollar to .8 Euros.
    Sandra: In that case, I'd like 500 U.S. dollars.
    Bank clerk: Okay. That will be 400 Euros. Would you like that in large or small bills?
    Sandra: I'd like a mix of both, I'd like some change, too.
    Bank clerk: That's no problem. Please sign here. That will be $300 in $20's, $150 in $10's, and $45 in $5's and $1's. And, here's $5 in change: quarters, dimes, and nickels.
    Sandra: That's perfect. Thanks a lot.
    Bank clerk: Is there anything else I can help you with?
    Sandra: No, that's all. Thanks for your help.
    Bank clerk: It's my pleasure. Have a nice day.

    [Music]

    Today's podcast is called Changing Money. To change, C-H-A-N-G-E, money means to convert it from one country's money to another country's money. So, to take your dollars, for example, U.S. dollars and convert them, or change them into yen, or euros, or whatever the country's money is.

    The story here is that Gustavo is picking up his friend Sandra from Italy. Gustavo goes to the airport and asks Sandra, Do you have everything, meaning, Do you have all of your bags, Do you have all of the things that you need. He's picking her up from the airport, and so he wants to make sure that she has all of the things that she needs for them to leave the airport.

    Sandra says, Yes, I think so. But I don't have any U.S. dollars. Where can I change money? Can I do it here? Where can I change money, as we said before, Where can I convert my money into U.S dollars. Gustavo tells her that he would not recommend changing money at the airport.

    To recommend, R-E-C-O-M-M-E-N-D, means here the same as to suggest. I recommend talking to that beautiful woman sitting over there. I think she's interested in you. Well, Gustavo is not talking about beautiful women. He's talking about the exchange rate.

    He's telling Sandra that she should not change money at the airport because the exchange rate is really high. The exchange, E-X-C-H-A-N-G-E, rate, R-A-T-E, tells you how many dollars you can get for how many, in this case, euros, or whatever the money is.

    I should say that another word we use for money when we are talking about changing money is currency. C-U-R-R-E-N-C-Y. So you can say the currency of Italy is the euro. That's what they call their money that they use now.

    Well, the exchange rate is really high, Gustavo says, which means that you are not going to get very many dollars for the euro if you change the money at the airport. Gustavo also says that the fees are high.

    A fee, F-E-E, is like a price that you have to pay for something. And when you change money, or exchange money, means the same thing, at the airport, you'll often have to pay an extra fee in order to change your money.

    Gustavo tell Sandra that he will take her to a bank tomorrow where she can exchange her money.

    Brockovich: I'll never forget the first day I met Julia Roberts. Because I was on set that day to do my little waitress thing.

      So, I was sitting in a chair just like this, in front of a mirror. And they were doing my hair. And Julia wasn't really hanging out with me. And Steven Soderbergh, my understanding, had said, You know, I don't want you to just mimic her. And if you just hang out with her you might mimic her. I want you to have a way though that you can understand this person.

      And, so, I wasn't, you know, how some people in movies, they hang out with each other, and stuff like that. I wasn't, a lot, given that opportunity.

      So, she came in a door, right over here to the right. And I saw her come in, in the mirror. And she walked right by me, and stopped. And so, she was here, and she looked down. And I looked up, and she goes, Hi, I'm Julia Roberts. She extended her hand. And I'm like, shrinking violet. Hi, I'm Erin Brockovich. And she turned around and she goes, I'm so embarrassed. I don't even have my boobs in yet. And it completely broke the ice. And I was like, Oh, how cool.

      It was a thrill to meet her. And her energy's just fabulous. And her smile. So it was an awkward moment, but thrilling none the less. And all based on, because she didn't have her boobs in yet. It was perfect.

And this miserable old man--I had him for second year accounting and business law--he said to me, "Ms. Casciato, you are the only woman who has ever gotten this far in my class. And I will make sure every day is a living hell for you."

   And he used to grade us on our class participation and how we would answer questions. And he said to me at the beginning of every class, "I hope you are prepared, Ms. Casciato, because the most difficult question of the period will be yours." And I would smile. I mean, this is how backward the world was.

   Christine: So then you graduated from Douglass. And how many job interviews did you have to go on?

   Tia: I think I wrote 80 letters. I don't know how many jobs I applied to and when I went in for the first interview--and this is like a vivid memory--I owned one dress. It was shades of red and pink and these big block geometric squares. It had short sleeves and it was a mini-dress and I had tights and heels on. And I walked in and this guy--he interviewed me for 15 minutes and then he said, "You need to stand up and turn around."

   And I said, "What are you talking about?"

   He said, "Stand up and turn around."

   And I stood up and I leaned over his desk and I said, "I don't need this job this much."

   And that's when he said, "You're hired."

   That's the way it was. And I think it's like that today only it's much more subtle.

   Christine: How hard was it then to work and take care of Steven and then me later on.

   Tia: I really had this idea that I could do everything a hundred percent. You know like you can be a hundred percent worker, a hundred percent mother, a hundred percent wife. And you can't. It's impossible.  And you have these terrible decisions to make: Do you stay home? Do you work? Do you go after the brass ring in your career? What do you do with your children? You unconditionally love them and you would give anything for them. You would give up your life, your career, your home. It's complicated. It's complicated.

    JUNE SIMMS: Sometimes international aid fails to reach the target population. The United Nations has been investigating reports that food aid was stolen in Mogadishu. Some reports said businessmen were even selling the aid in markets.

    Two months ago, witnesses in Mogadishu said seven people were killed when people began stealing food that was sent to famine and drought victims. They said the violence began when men who looked like government soldiers began stealing the food. Reports said pro-government forces guarding the food shot at the men.

    BARBARA KLEIN: The movement of foreign aid has historically been difficult to follow. It is not always clear how the money is spent and if the aid is reaching the target communities.

    In an effort to solve this problem, two American universities and Development Gateway created a registration system called AidDATA. It was established ten years ago as a way to register aid activities and improve the public's knowledge of international aid finances.

    Student: Mr Gates, Dead Aid, a book by Dambisa Moyo, illustrates that giving more aid in Africa over the course of the years did not ..
    
    [cut]

    .. a cycle of aid-giving, which resulted in nothing productive. It has not been used to solve immediate problems, nothing except solving immediate problems. And the money is not being used to make businesses sustainable in Africa. What is the Foundation's view in this regard?

    Chairman: It's obviously a question about whether aid in Africa has had negative consequences. There's been new analyses about that.

    Gates: Well, it depends on your value system. Over the last 20 years, the number of children who die in Africa every year has been cut in half. And is that good or not good? It's largely due to vaccines, and the aid programs that have been there in Africa. I think that that book actually did damage generosity in First World countries. People have excused various cutbacks because of it.

    Chairman: You've read the book, obviously.

    Gates: Actually, yes.

    Chairman: Did you find anything in it of use?

    Gates: I found that she didn't know much about aid and what aid was doing. And she is an aid critic. There's not many, because it's moralistically a tough position to take, given what aid has been able to do. But if you look objectively at what aid has been able to do, you would never accuse it of creating a dependency. Having children not die is not creating a dependency. Having children not be so sick they can't go to school, not having enough nutrition so their brains don't develop, that is not a dependency. That is an evil thing. And books like that, they're promoting evil.

    McQuillan: Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast, Number 783, Different Political Philosophies. [Music] This is English as a Second Language Podcast, Episode 783. I'm your host, Dr Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. Where else? Our website is E-S-L-P-O-D dot com. Go there and take a look at the ESL Podcast store, as well as our ESL Podcast blog. You can also become a member of ESL Podcast and get our ESL Podcast Learning Guide. Wow! All of those things on our website.

    This episode is a dialogue between Carla and Adam talking about everyone's favorite subject, politics. Let's get started.

    [Music]

    Carla: Our government should do more to help people who can't find jobs. 

    Adam: Be careful. You're starting to sound like a socialist. Haven't you always said that you're a staunch capitalist? 

    Carla: Of course, I'm a capitalist, but that doesn't mean I think the government should be completely hands-off. We pay taxes and the government has a responsibility to take care of its citizens. 

    Adam: Ooo, now you're sounding like a communist. Next thing I know, you'll be calling for a revolution. 

    Carla: I'm serious. I think the government should help people find jobs and pay for their living expenses until they get back on their feet. 

    Adam: Okay, but in a capitalistic society, you're subject to market forces. If people aren't buying, businesses aren't producing or providing services. That puts people out of work. Do you think the government should intervene? 

    Carla: I just think the government should do more, that's all. 

    Adam: Okay, but that would mean higher taxes. 

    Carla: Yes, we should tax the rich, the more the better. 

    Adam: Aren't you among the top 10 percent of income earners? 

    Carla: I mean they should tax the one percent! 

    Adam: Pass the buck, you mean. 

    Carla: No, I mean we need better distribution of wealth. Are you with me or against me? 

    Adam: That depends on when you're planning to start the revolution, comrade.

    [Music]

    McQuillan: Carla begins our dialogue by saying to Adam, Our government should do more to help people who can't find jobs, who can't find work. Adam says, Be careful. You're starting to sound like a socialist.

    A socialist is someone who believes in socialism, the political philosophy that the government should own and run a large number of the businesses in a society, or should basically be in charge of the economy, to a greater extent. A capitalist would be someone who believes the businesses should be owned by individuals and not be interfered with by the government. Those of course are very broad differences, but I think you get the idea.
    
    Adam says, Haven't you always said that you're a staunch capitalist?  He's asking Carla. Carla says, Of course, I'm a capitalist, but that doesn't mean I think the government should be completely hands-off.

    To be hands-off means not to be involved. Carla's saying the government should be involved in the economy somehow. In this case, to help people who don't have jobs.
    
    Carla says, We pay taxes and the government has a responsibility to take care of its citizens.

    Taxes, you probably know, is money that you pay to the government, either when you buy something, or when you make money at your job. Carla says, The government has a responsibility to take care of, to watch over, its citizens. Citizens are people who belong to a certain country. I'm a citizen of the United States. I have a United States passport.

    Well, Adam says, Ooo, now you're sounding like a communist. A communist would be a person who believes the government should basically run the entire economy. That everything should be in the hands of the government. A socialist would not want the government to own all of the means of production. They would not want the government to control everything. A communist however, would want the government to be in charge of the entire economy. Once again, I know that's not a perfect description, but it's the general idea when we're talking about the economic aspects of these different philosophies.
    
    Adam says, Next thing I know, you'll be calling for a revolution. The expression, "next thing I know", is used to predict what might happen in the future, but usually when we say this, you're kind of joking, you're being sarcastic. Next thing I know, you'll be calling for a revolution. Adam doesn't really think Carla will be calling for, or asking for, or demanding a revolution. A revolution is, usually when you take over the government in order to change the government, often by using violence.

    [7:45]

    But Carla doesn't want to joke the way Adam does ...

    McQuillan: Welcome to English as a Second Language Podcast, Number 1119, Methods for Quitting Smoking. [Music] This is English as a Second Language Podcast, Episode 1119. I'm your host, Dr Jeff McQuillan, coming to you from the Center for Educational Development in beautiful Los Angeles, California. Visit our website at E-S-L-P-O-D dot com. Take a look at our ESL Podcast special courses in business and daily English.
      
    On this episode of ESL Podcast, we're going to talk about someone who is trying to quit smoking. To stop smoking cigarettes. Let's get started.

    [Music]

    Lisa: This is it. I'm quitting smoking for good.
    Michael: Good for you. Are you going cold turkey?
    Lisa: No, I tried that, but it didn't work. I craved cigarettes too much.
    Michael: How about nicotine gum? Have you tried that?
    Lisa: Yes, but I didn't like the side effects. It irritated my throat.
    Michael: That's too bad. I suppose you've tried nicotine patches, too?
    Lisa: Yes, I have. I became addicted to the patches and couldn't wean myself off of them. I just traded one addiction for another.
    Michael: And electronic cigarettes?
    Lisa: They only made me want to smoke a real cigarette. They were no help at all.
    Michael: So, what now?
    Lisa: I'm going to try hypnosis. I hear that it works for some people.
    Michael: And if that doesn't work?
    Lisa: The last resort is acupuncture. Some people say that's effective for quitting smoking.
    Michael: If you say so. Sometimes the cure is truly worse than the disease!

    [Music]

    Lisa begins our dialog by saying, 'This is it. I'm quitting smoking for good.' 'To quit smoking' means to stop smoking cigarettes and never smoke them again. 'For good,' is an expression we use to mean 'forever, permanently, from now on.' My girlfriend and I have broken up for good. We're not ever going to get back together. Michael says to Lisa, 'Good for you,' after she tells him she is going to quit smoking, or stop smoking. 'Good for you,' which is another way of congratulating someone, saying that they have done something good. He says, 'Are you going cold turkey?' The phrase, 'to go cold turkey,' T-U-R-K-E-Y, means to quit something immediately, not to use a little less today, and perhaps a little less the day after that, until you finally stop. But rather to stop immediately, without trying to reduce your use before you stop using it.

    Lisa says, 'No, I tried that, but it didn't work.' She tried going cold turkey, but it didn't work. You may be wondering why it's called 'cold turkey.' No-one knows exactly for sure. The original meaning of the expression was to speak plainly, to not try to use big words, or complicated sentences, but to speak the truth in a simple way. So perhaps, the idea of quitting something immediately without any other sorts of devices or approaches.. But in any case, nowadays 'to go cold turkey' means to stop doing some sort of bad habit, like smoking, immediately. Lisa says she is not going to go cold turkey. She says, I craved cigarettes too much, refering to the last time she tried to stop smoking that way. 'To crave,' C-R-A-V-E, something is to have a very strong desire to eat it, or drink it, or have it. Usually, we crave things that are physical pleasures, like for example the pleasure of eating, or drinking certain kinds of drink.

    Rob: Hello. I'm Rob and this is Finn. 
    Finn: Hi Rob. 
    Rob: Finn you sound down in the dumps--you know, miserable. 
    Finn: I am. It's raining. I have no money. And I feel unfit too! 
    Rob: I've got some news that might put a smile on your face. It's about a study that tells us how to be happier. And we'll be using some words about happiness too. 
    Finn: That sounds good. I'm feeling happier already.
    Rob: What things make you feel happy?
    Finn: The finer things in life--good food, fine wine, things like that. And you?
    Rob: For me, everything! Nothing worries me. I always look for the positive things even in a bad situation. You could say I'm happy-go-lucky! Now, let's see if you know the answer to today's question. The World Happiness Database has ranked countries in order of how happy their people are, or their 'satisfaction with life'. Which country came top of the list? Was it: Finland, Canada, or Costa Rica?
    Finn: I think Finland has a high quality of life but let's say the happiest nation is Canada.
    Rob: Canada, ok. We'll find out if you are right at the end of the program. So, let's talk more about happiness. There's been some good news from Holland--that's where the World Happiness Database is--at the Erasmus University in Rotterdam. 
    Finn: It's been collecting the results of studies about happiness from all over the world. 
    Rob: And now all that information has been put together to produce some interesting results.
    Finn: Rob, happiness is a state of mind. So different things will make different people content, or happy, depending on their mood or situation at the time?
    Rob: Yes, but this research has found some factors that we all share when we are looking for happiness. It also found what makes people unhappy.
    Finn: So, maybe things like not having enough money or not going on holiday?
    Rob: Nothing like that, not materialistic values. Unhappy people are more aware of their life goals, things they want to achieve because they want to change their life for the better. Does that sound like you Finn?
    Finn: Not me Rob. I lead such a hectic--or busy--life that I don't have time to think about the future!
    Rob: That's good because the study found that having an active life is most important for a happy and rewarding life and a feeling of satisfaction and pleasure. There are other reasons too as we can hear from the Director of the World Happiness Database, Professor Veenhoven. When in life does he say we are happiest?

    [..]

    Finn: OK, happiness changes over time. Older people--the elderly--are happiest because they are wiser. They understand things more and have learned to deal with problems in life. So Rob, you're old. You should be happy, right?
    Rob: Wrong! The study has also found having children lowers your happiness level.
    Finn: But it does say your happiness increases when your children grow up and leave home. 
    Rob: That's good to hear. The study also says if you think you're good looking, rather than if you actually are good-looking, you are happier. So you might be really ugly but if you think you're handsome then you're happy. Isn't that right Finn?
    Finn: Right, I guess that makes me the happiest man on the planet, Rob!
    Rob: Did you also know, being in a long-term relationship and going out for dinner a lot also makes you happier. 
    Finn: Oh, so are you saying I need to do these things to be happy?
    Rob: Yes Finn. But luckily, the study has also found that being sad for 10 percent of the time is actually good for you. Let's face it. We can't be happy all the time!
    Finn: That's comforting. But Rob you can cheer me up--make me happier--by telling me if my answer to today's question was correct.
    Rob: We'll see! Earlier I asked you which country did The World Happiness Database rank as having the greatest 'satisfaction with life'? 
    Finn: I said Canada.
    Rob: I'm sure the Canadians are very happy, but you're wrong. All those countries are in the top ten but Costa Rica is at number one.

    Okay. Well, I guess you know that Steve and, Steve Hoover and me are writing a textbook for, going to use next semester. And the idea is that we publish it ourselves, not through a publisher like Crane, or whatever. And we start publishing books, not just our books, but other books.

    Now, we're really excited about this. We have money, although of course, we need more. The problem is we're teachers, not business people, and we need people to manage the company, people to make the business decisions. We aren't going to be making those decisions. We want you to make those decisions. So, in the class, we're going to ask you, I'm going to ask you, questions in the book. What are your ideas? Questions in the book. And, for example: How are we going to get capital? Where should the company be? And what strategy do we have? Do we expect the business to make money, to be a success? Or to lose money, to be a failure?

    Besides those questions, questions which are not in the book, and which I'd like you to think about are: 1. What's different about this company, this publishing company? How is it different than Crane, or whatever. 2. The team: What is special about the team. Why, You. Why are you going to be good managers of this company? Why are you going to succeed? 3. Second, thirdly: Market opportunity. Do people want the books that we are producing? Will the books be popular? Will we be able to sell our writing textbook? 4. And lastly, finance. How are we going to handle money? How will we use money to make the company bigger? What will we use the money when it comes in? And where are we going to get more money?

    That's it. Thanks a lot. Good luck.
