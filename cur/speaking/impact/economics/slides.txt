## Translate the Chinese

The economy's in a mess. The 
逆差
is getting larger,
生產率
is declining and
經濟增長
is stagnating.

If things get worse, we'll be in a 
不景氣

M: The government should encourage 
出口
to reduce the 
逆差
and boost 
消費
to stimulate
經濟增長.

C: The government is afraid of 
通貨膨脹.
All the 
市場調查
I've seen indicates that prices won't increase fast.
We have to focus on avoiding
不景氣.

# Dr Bean and Steve's textbook publishing company

## Dr Bean and Steve's plan to publish a writing textbook (p 83)

They are teachers, not businessmen. They need managers, who will make the business decisions, to run the company.

You are those managers.

Make decisions about:

	- The name of the publishing company
	- Capital
	- Location
	- Marketing strategy
	- Business forecast

## Talk about day-to-day decisions you make at the publishing company.

Use the questions from the book, eg We should try to get a loan from the bank. We have to employ sales people to visit bookstores.

## Talk about factors that will determine the success of the publishing company {.allowframebreaks}

- Innovation: What is special about the idea?
  	- If there is nothing special, the company won't be able to survive.
- Team: What is special about the team?
  	- If there is nothing special, the company won't be able to survive. Does the team understand the market?
- Market opportunity: Why do people want the books that the company publishes? 
  	- Talk about the buyers of the books. If the books aren't books they want, the company won't be able to survive.
- Money: Does the team understand money and how to use it to decide what the company should do?
  	- If they don't and can't get investment, the company won't be able to survive.

## Criticism of the textbook, Communication Strategies 2 {.allowframebreaks}

Steve likes the textbook because it includes a lot of big issues: Conversation textbooks usually have very light content, about unimportant issues.

Dr Bean doesn't like the textbook because:

1. the language level is too high. It is difficult even for native speakers to discuss the issues in the book.
2. There is no listening/soundfile component.
3. The content is too abstract and the role plays/situations don't provide enough support to allow good conversation, because the students don't feel involved.

What do you think about the textbook? What kind of textbook should the publishing company publish?

## Textbook publishing--the economics {.allowframebreaks}

Textbooks nowadays include DVDs, Internet tests, etc, which increases the cost. This is one reason textbook prices are getting a lot higher.

Publishers are under pressure from students and teachers to make them cheaper. (Students don't make decisions on which textbook to buy, so it is difficult for them to put pressure on publishers.)

But publishers are not making lots of money, because many teachers are using their own material or free textbooks on the Internet, and not requiring students to buy textbooks. Students are also photocopying textbooks or buying second-hand copies.

What should the publishing company do about the conflict in interests it has with students and teachers.

- The publishing company wants to make as much money as possible.
- Students and teachers want to spend as little money as possible.
