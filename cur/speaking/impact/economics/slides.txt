## Translate the Chinese

The economy's in a mess. The 
逆差
is getting larger,
生產率
is declining and
經濟增長
is stagnating.

If things get worse, we'll be in a 
不景氣

M: The government should encourage 
出口
to reduce the 
逆差
and boost 
消費
to stimulate
經濟增長.

C: The government is afraid of 
通貨膨脹.
All the 
市場調查
I've seen indicates that prices won't increase fast.
We have to focus on avoiding
不景氣.





## Dr Bean and Yoko

- He has little interest in political affairs, but he interested in talking about political ideologies.
- She is interested in elections in Japan and is radical, voting for communist candidates and opposition parties and against the government party in power.

## Dr Bean's mother and father

- Dr Bean's father came from a middle-class family and he supported moderate right-wing candidates. In the US, he would have voted for the Republican Party.
- Dr Bean's mother came from a working-class family and she supported moderate left-wing candidates. In the US, she would have voted for the Democratic Party.

## Steve Hoover and his wife

- Steve (I think) has good things to say about the DPP, despite Chen SuiBian.
- Steve's wife is Hakka, and apparently supports the KMT, judging from what he has said to me.

Ask him.

The Hakka have traditionally supported the KMT, haven't they?

They have opposed Taiwanese independence movements for hundreds of years, haven't they?

## Left-wing--Right-wing

- [Left-wing politics - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-wing)
- [Right-wing politics - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia ](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Right-wing)

## Your experience

Tell your group your experience of other people's political views

Eg, your family, or friends, or famous figures

## Politics and other topics to avoid on first meetings

According to, [Mastering the Art of Small Talk ](http://www.ou.edu/class/bc2813/ConversationTips/MasteringSmallTalk.htm):

When you first meet a person, avoid these unpleasant, overly
personal, or highly controversial issues because they can quickly
degenerate into depressing conversations or arguments:

- Sex, politics, and religion.
- Personal, health, money, or family problems.
- Divorce or death.
- Gory crimes and decaying moral values of Western civilization.
- Layoffs and gloomy economic predictions.
- Terrorism, war, pestilence, and famine.
- Emotionally charged issues such as abortion, welfare, or capital
punishment.

## Dr Bean and Steve's plan to publish a writing textbook (p 83)

They are teachers, not businessmen. They need managers, who will make the business decisions, to run the company.

You are those managers.

Make decisions about:

	- Capital
	- Location
	- Marketing strategy
	- Business forecast
