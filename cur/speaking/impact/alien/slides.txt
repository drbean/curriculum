## Warm-up questions (from Communication Strategies)

- Do you think there is intelligent life on other planets?
- Do you think aliens have visited the earth in UFOs?
- If aliens visit the earth in big numbers, will they be friendly or aggressive?
- Do you think aliens could be living among us now?

## the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence

- The universe is vast (infinitely big.)
- Physics is the same throughout the universe.
- The development of biological and chemical things follows physical laws.
- Natural evolution can occur anywhere.
- So, some scientists think there is a very good chance life exists in space.

But where is it?

And do we want to find it?

Think about the effect of European explorers on Native Americans. Think of the effect of the development of Taiwan by people from mainland China on the aboriginals of Taiwan.

## Bingo
