## Art robbery cloze

Also, while most high-profile museums have extremely tight security, many places with multi-million art collections works have disproportionately poor security measures.^ That makes them susceptible to thefts that are slightly more complicated than a typical smash-and-grab, but offer a huge potential payoff. Thieves sometimes target works based on their own familiarity with the artist, rather than the artist's reputation in the art world or the theoretical value of the work.^  Unfortunately for the thieves, it is extremely difficult to sell the most famous and valuable famous works without getting caught, since any interested buyer will almost certainly know the work is stolen and advertising it risks someone contacting the authorities. It is also difficult for the buyer to display the work to visitors without it being recognized as stolen, thus defeating much of the point of owning the art. Many famous works have instead been held for ransom from the legitimate owner or even returned without ransom, due to the lack of black-market customers. Returning for ransom also risks a sting operation.^

One thing that you have to do, but other people don't. What kind of thing is it?

# Carlos Rocha regrets killing inmate after brother is killed the same way


Prison violence is inflicted onto either another inmate, a prison guard, or themselves.

The attacks that are implemented onto anyone but the self are either instrumental or expressive
