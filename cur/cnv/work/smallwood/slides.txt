- [Tia Smallwood talks to her daughter, Christine about the difficulties of being a woman at a school and in a business world dominated by men. ](http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87965100)

Studying finance at Rutgers University, she was treated     meanly and unfairly by a teacher, and at her first job interview, the boss    used offensive language with her. She also had to make tough decisions about  her children, her marriage and her career. She wanted to give 100 percent to  all three. But that was not possible.

She says that things were not good in the 1970's when she    was young. But she says men still think the same. The only difference is that they are more careful about how they express themselves, ie they are more     subtle.

# Grammar

## You have these terrible decisions to make: Do you stay home? Do you work? Do you go ..

I was losing my full-time job at NUU. I had these terrible decisions to make:

- Do I leave 台灣?
- Do I look for a job at another college?
- Should I stay in 台灣, even if I only have a part-time job and no ARC?
- Do I look for a job in a 補習班?
