# Grammar with Collins

## A good idea

I THOUGHT, "I'm GOING to wear my necktie." WHILE they WERE THINKING about her case, I suddenly SAID, "Mrs Pepitone." I WALKED over and SAID, "I'm GOING to put my hand on your forehead." The others WERE all STANDING there with their mouths open. They THOUGHT I HAD GONE mad.

I thought, "I'm going to play my kazoo." While they were looking at the book, I said, "I'm going to play the sentence on the kazoo. I want you to choose which sentence I'm playing." While I played it, they were sitting there with their hands over their ears. Apparently, they thought the sound was disturbing.

Your example?
