    What makes a painting a great work of art? There are many answers to that question. Some people think a painting should look pretty. Others disagree. The skill of the painter is important. The techniques used are also important. Most of all a great painting has meaning. A great painting has a special element in it.

    Sometimes, a painter's special element is the way he portrays his or her feelings in a piece of art.

    An example of this is Picasso's painting, Guernica. It has strange shapes in it. It shows suffering people, too. It is not a very pretty picture. However, it makes people understand Picasso's feelings about war.

    Other times, the element is a memory or feeling. This comes from inside another person. Someone may see a painting and be reminded of a beautiful memory. A painting can also remind people of a feeling.

    For example, Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa is very popular. Many people like her smile. Some people say it is a mysterious smile. Others say it is a happy one. Still others make up stories about the woman in the painting.

    Which element is the most important? Is it the skill of the artist or the feelings of the person looking at the painting? Whatever the case, a painting that grabs people's emotions is popular.

    B: Barrel drums? What are those?
    M: They are made with hollow logs and animal skins. First, they cut down a tree. They cut a section that's about as thick and tall as a barrel. They stretch an animal skin over the top, and tie it to the sides with wooden pegs. These pegs can be tightened to change the pitch.
    M: In Nigeria, they have "talking" drums. They use a hollow trunk that's smaller than a barrel drum, and leave an opening at both ends. Then they fit an animal skin...

    M: .. on each end. There's a string between each of these ends. When a player holds the drum under an armpit and squeezes it, it tightens the string and raises the pitch.
    B: Why do they call it a "talking" drum?B: Hmm.. That sounds interesting.
    M: The drummers are so skillful they can make the drums imitate human voices. They seem to cry, laugh and shout.
