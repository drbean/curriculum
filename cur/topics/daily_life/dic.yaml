    A: Andy Lai! Welcome to Top of the Pops. How are you?
    B: I'm great, Tanya. It's great to be here in the US.
    A: You're a famous singer, Andy. But can I ask you something?
    B: Of course. Ask me about what I do when I'm not singing.
    A: OK. First, how old are you?
    B: I will be 25 years old next month.
    A: Do you come from Hong Kong? Do you live there?
    B: Yes, I was born and have lived there my whole life?
    A: Now, you are on tour in the US. Do you like traveling?
    B: Yes, but I prefer to be at home in Hong Kong?
    A: Why is that? Is Hong Kong exciting? 
    B: Yes, and I have a nice view of the harbor.
    A: What is your favorite thing to do at home?
    B: I like to play music in the living room.
