    B: Hello Wendy! Who did you do your assignment about?
    G: I wrote about my dad because he is a firefighter.
    B: Really? Does he actually go into burning buildings?
    G: Yes, and he sometimes has to crawl into tight spaces to rescue people.
    B: Has he ever been trapped in a burning building?
    G: Well, one time he needed to break down a door. He was carrying a little girl out of her house.

    B: Your dad is incredibly brave, a real hero. What does he do at the fire station?
    G: He resides there for a few days when he works. All of the firefighters cook, eat and clean together. When there's a fire, they slide down a pole inot the fire station's garage to get their fire-fighting equipment. They quickly put on their gear and then jump onto the fire trucks. My dad loves to drive the fire trucks.
    B: Wow! Maybe I should be a firefighter someday.
