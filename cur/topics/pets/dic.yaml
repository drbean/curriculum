    B: Mom, can I get a puppy?
    W: No, Billy. Taking care of a pet is a big responsibility.
    B: I promise to take good care of him, and you won't have to remind me to do things for him.
    W: A dog isn't a toy that you play with for a while. He will be part of your life for the next 10 or 20 years. He is a living creature.

    W: ... and has to go to the vet to get shots. A dog also needs companionship. You can't go off with your friends and leave him locked up in the house all day.
    B: I understand, Mom. I have almost \$100 in the bank so I can pay for his license and shots now.

    W: I think we should discuss this with your father when he gets home. This is a family decision.
    B: OK, Mom. Thanks!
