    B: I can't think of anything to write, and it's due tomorrow. To make matters worse, we have to perform an oral presentation in front of the entire class. I don't see the purpose of writing a book report, anyway.
    W: Writing is a necessary skill that you'll use for the rest of your life. This book report is just one way to begin learning that skill. It's another form of communication and a means of expressing your thoughts. It allows others to understand what is in your heart and mind.

    B: I've never had to write before. Why should I start now.
    W: Now is the best time to begin. The best writers read a lot, and practice writing. Anyone can learn to write well. I know you can do it.
    B: OK, Mom. When you put it that way, I think I can do it.
    W: That's the right attitude. Let's try to organize some of your thoughts by brainstorming. What can you tell me about the book?
    B: The book? I've only watched the movie!
    W: Oh, dear! What kind of child am I raising?

    W: I heard that the psychology professor is tough but fair. If you work hard, you can get a good grade.
    M: Psych sounds nice.
    W: How about we both sign up for psychology? Then we'd be in the same class, and we could help each other with assignments.
    M: I remember the last class we took together. I'm not so sure that's a good idea.
    W: Oh, come on. It would be fun. I promise I'll attend the classes and not just borrow your notes this time.

    M: Thanks!
    W: I was thinking about taking film studies. Why don't you take that?
    M: I like going to the movies, but I don't want to study them.
    W: I know someone who took the course last year, and she said it's very easy. Almost everyone gets an "A" or a "B." And there is no homework.
    M: That is tempting, but I want to learn something useful.
    W: Fine, but don't complain to me if you get a "C."
