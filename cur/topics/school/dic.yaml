    B: I can't think of anything to write, and it's due tomorrow. To make matters worse, we have to perform an oral presentation in front of the entire class. I don't see the purpose of writing a book report, anyway.
    W: Writing is a necessary skill that you'll use for the rest of your life. This book report is just one way to begin learning that skill. It's another form of communication and a means of expressing your thoughts. It allows others to understand what is in your heart and mind.

    B: I've never had to write before. Why should I start now.
    W: Now is the best time to begin. The best writers read a lot, and practice writing. Anyone can learn to write well. I know you can do it.
    B: OK, Mom. When you put it that way, I think I can do it.
    W: That's the right attitude. Let's try to organize some of your thoughts by brainstorming. What can you tell me about the book?
    B: The book? I've only watched the movie!
    W: Oh, goodness! What will become of you?
