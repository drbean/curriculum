    M: I love this amusement park, Fran! Thanks for suggesting it. I am having a fantastic time. There's that new ride! It's called, the Volcano, and it's supposed to be amazing.
    W: That looks awfully high. Do you really want to try it? We've experienced the Rocket, the giant ferris wheel and those bumper boats. Don't you think that is enough? Besides, I'm absolutely starving.
    M: If you come on the Volcano with me, I'll buy you a pizza with whatever toppings you want.
    W: Do you really mean any topping, even mushrooms, which you don't like?
    M: Yes, I will even order a pizza with mushrooms!
    W: OK, Michael. I will try this last ride.

    M: Great, Fran! I know you will enjoy this. Did you know that when the volcano erupts, our seats shake? I heard it is quite an experience.
    W: I am not sure that I want to get on this ride anymore.
    M: Don't worry, Fran. Look at the people getting off the ride. They look very..
    W: I'm sorry, but I don't think I can do this, even for pizza. How would you feel if I bought lunch instead?
    M: I don't really want to force you to do something you really don't want to do.

    The lates blockbuster movie, Robots Attack 2, starring Harrison Ford opened yesterday. Ford and Andy Robot are at it again, saving people from the jaws of death. the evil robots are invading Atlantis once again. The crowds seemed to love the sequel. Maybe they loved it as much, if not more than, the first Robots Attack. The special effects are fantastic. Mr. Ford seems to have worked on his fighting technique. His martial skills are amazing. He beats the evil robots easily.

    Of course, Ford saves a lady in distress, the fair Angie, who falls in love with him. However Andy is jealous of this new love. He spends a good part of the movie trying to ruin their plans. Another surprise is the evil robot, Homer, who decides he wants to become a do-gooder. His partner, Ethel, tries to make him return to his evil ways.
    Can Andy rescue Ford from love? What about Ethel? Does she return Homer to his evil ways? To find out, head for the theater, buy a ticket, sit back and relax.
