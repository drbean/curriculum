    W: I'm so excited! I just got back from the travel agency.
    M: Travel agency? Where are you going?
    W: I'm planning to go to Canada on vacation.
    M: Canada! How exciting! How long are you going for?
    W: I'm going for a month. I want to see as much as I can!
    M: You are so lucky! What places are you going to visit?
    W: First, I'll spend a few days in Vancouver. Then I'll take a train through the Rocky Mountains.

    M: Oh, you're riding through the Rockies! That's really exciting!
    W: Then I'll fly to Toronto, and take a bus to Niagara Falls. Did you know that you can actually take a boat under that huge waterfall? It's called Maid of the Mist.
    M: Wow! That's an amazing thing to do! You're so lucky!
    W: Well, I hope I don't get seasick! I'll finish my trip in Nova Scotia. I want to eat lobster for dinner every night. And I'd like to bike around some small fishing villages, too.
    M: Have a great time, and take lots of pictures!
