    W: I'm so excited! I just got back from the travel agency.
    M: Travel agency? Where are you going?
    W: I'm planning to go to Canada on vacation.
    M: Canada! How exciting! How long are you going for?
    W: I'm going for a month. I want to see as much as I can!
    M: You are so lucky! What places are you going to visit?
    W: First, I'll spend a few days in Vancouver. Then I'll take a train through the Rocky Mountains.

    M: Oh, you're riding through the Rockies! That's really exciting!
    W: Then I'll fly to Toronto, and take a bus to Niagara Falls. Did you know that you can actually take a boat under that huge waterfall? It's called Maid of the Mist.
    M: Wow! That's an amazing thing to do! You're so lucky!
    W: Well, I hope I don't get seasick! I'll finish my trip in Nova Scotia. I want to eat lobster for dinner every night. And I'd like to bike around some small fishing villages, too.
    M: Have a great time, and take lots of pictures!

    B: I haven't seen you for two whole weeks! Where did you go on vacation?
    G: I visited my cousin in New Mexico. I had a great time!
    B: Mexico? I thought you went to the US.
    G: I did. New Mexico is a state in the southwestern US. It's between Texas and Arizona. Guess what? A lot of Americans don't know that New Mexico is a state.. The license plates on cars in New Mexico also say "USA." This is so that people don't get confused and think the driver is from Mexico.

    B: That's funny! So, tell me what did you do in New Mexico.
    G: My favorite part was visiting Carlsbad Caverns. There are 30 miles of caves. In one cave we had to wear hats with lights on them so we could see in the dark. Sometimes we had to crawl through very narrow tunnels on our hands and knees.
    B: Weren't you scared?
    G: No, it was a lot of fun! I"m going to visit my cousin again next year. You should come with me.
