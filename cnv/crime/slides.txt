## Art robbery cloze

Also, while most high-profile museums have extremely tight security, many places with multi-million art collections works have disproportionately poor security measures.^ That makes them susceptible to thefts that are slightly more complicated than a typical smash-and-grab, but offer a huge potential payoff. Thieves sometimes target works based on their own familiarity with the artist, rather than the artist's reputation in the art world or the theoretical value of the work.^  Unfortunately for the thieves, it is extremely difficult to sell the most famous and valuable famous works without getting caught, since any interested buyer will almost certainly know the work is stolen and advertising it risks someone contacting the authorities. It is also difficult for the buyer to display the work to visitors without it being recognized as stolen, thus defeating much of the point of owning the art. Many famous works have instead been held for ransom from the legitimate owner or even returned without ransom, due to the lack of black-market customers. Returning for ransom also risks a sting operation.^

## It's the kind of thing most people don't have to learn to cope with. 

One thing that you have to do, but other people don't. What kind of thing is it?

Or, one thing that most people DO have to learn to cope with.

Say:

"I try to avoid cigarette smoke and cigarette smokers. It the kind of thing most non-smokers have to learn to cope with."

That is, ways of avoiding cigarette smoke and cigarette smokers.

## Cope with/Deal with

## I didn't look at it like I took somebody's life that really mattered. 

I looked at it like he was a criminal just like me. 

Dr Bean's examples:

- Before I started teaching English, I looked at teaching like it was not interesting, not worthwhile.
- Now I am a teacher, I look at it as very interesting, and very worthwhile.

- When I was school, I looked at learning French like it was not a real subject.

## Dow's letter to the editor

The Delta Democrat-Times from Greenville, Mississippi · Page 4, Monday, Nov 6, 1972http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/22199921/

To the editor: A petition was drawn up about two weeks ago to support the Superintendent of Parchman (John A. Collier). The petition was drawn up by a    inmate and with the help of black and white friends it was circulated. The petition was a plea to the people, to the Governor and elected officials of Mississippi to untie    the Superintendent's hands and give him their suport and allow him to do the job he was sent here to do. Due to the fact that the administration had nothing to do with the    petition we were unable to reach all the inmates. We were aware that some inmates would remain neutral. We were also curious as to how many would oppose. That question    seems to have been answered for us when a letter was written to the editor of the Clarion-Ledger stating that 91 inmates did not agree with the petition. The letter also    stated that the blacks were against the support petition. I fail to understand how the writer could make such a statement. Please note, population wise, Parchman is about    70 per cent black,.30 per cent white. The petition was not a matter of races but due to the population factor the petition that has over 1,000 signatures is predominantly    black. We have the signatures. For the benefit of those that were opposed to the petition the petition was not an effort to defend Parchman but a petition supporting a man    (Big John Collier). Mr. Collier did not create the rundown conditions here at Parchman. The fact of the matter is he inherited the left-overs from political hassels since    1901. Please note the majority of the black and white inmates have signed the petition suporting the superintendent. The facts are here. Incidentally I am a black inmate    but I fail to understand how this would have any bearing on the truth. I respectfully request that you please print this letter of truth and facts. I remain respectfully:    Willie Earl Dow Dairy Camp Parchman

| Oh, listen you men
| I don't mean no harm
| Oh, listen you men
| I don't mean no harm
| If you wanna do good
| You better stay off old Parchman farm
| 
| We got to work in the mornin'
| Just at dawn of day
| We got to work in the mornin'
| Just at dawn of day
| Just at the settin' of the sun
| That's when the work is done
| 
| I'm down on Parchman farm
| I sho' wanna go back home
| I'm down on Parchman farm
| But I sho' wanna go back home
| But I hope some day
| I will overcome
