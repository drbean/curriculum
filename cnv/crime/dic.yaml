  - "Man remembers murder of daughter"
  - "conversation"

  - |+
    We learned about what had happened in bits and pieces. She came home and he was hiding in the closet hoping to jump out the back window and get away. But she opened the closet door and she fell backwards and he tied her hands behind her back. And they had a conversation in the course of which she told him that he needed to get help with his drug habit. He told her to put burglar bars on the back window and always leave a light on. He asked her for sex and she said, 'You'll have to kill me first.' And so he did. 
    
    We were all just devastated. Nothing like this had ever happened. I mean, we'd known death but not like this. I'd never been in favor of the death penalty, but I wanted that man to hurt the way he had hurt her. I wanted him to hurt the way I was hurting. But after a while I wanted to know who it was, what kind of a monster would do a thing like this and I learned a little bit about Ivan Simpson, which is his name. I found out that he was born in a mental hospital. And that when he was about 11 years old his mother took him and his brother and sister to a swimming pool and said God was ordering her to destroy them. He escaped and his brother escaped from her but he watched while his mother drowned his little sister. Suzie and I both went to the district attorney's office and he was quite upset when we told him that we did not want this man killed. He plead guilty to every charge. And then it came turn for anybody who had been affected by the crime to say how this crime had affected them. So I read my statement and in my statement I said, 'I don't hate you, Ivan Simpson. But I hate with all my soul what you did to my daughter.' And I looked in his eyes. The tears were streaming down his cheeks. And before he was led away he asked to speak and was lead to the microphone and he twice said, "I'm so sorry for the pain that I've caused." And when I got back to my room that night, I couldn't sleep because I really felt as though a tremendous weight had been lifted from me and that I had forgiven him.

    [1:27]
    Rick: At the time of the robbery I had just dropped out of Berklee College of Music. I was playing in a jam band, and working night shift at the museum. I was just this hippie guy who wasn't hurting anything, wasn't on anybody's radar, and the next day I was on everybody's radar for the largest art heist in history. You know most of the guards were either older or they were college students. Nobody there was capable of dealing with actual criminals. But that night 2 cops rang the doorbell. They had hats, badges. They looked like cops, and I let them in. They said, 'Are you here alone?' And I said, 'I have a partner that's out on a round.' They said, 'Call him down.' And they said, 'Gentlemen, this is a robbery.' They duct taped around our eyes and duct taped like the bottom of my chin to the top of my head, and they handcuffed me to the electrical box for seven hours. At first I was panicking, and then I started singing "I Shall Be Released" by Bob Dylan. I don't know how long I was singing that damn song for but it was quite some time. They took 3 Rembrandts, a Vermeer, a Manet, bunch of sketches by Degas. And two of the Rembrandts, they cut them out of the frames. So even if they get the paintings back they'll never be the same, and I feel horrible about that.

    Diana: You ever feel embarrassed about it?

    Rick: More than anything else I'm angry about it. I don't want to be remembered for this alone. I'd like to be remembered for the good things I've done. I'm a husband, a father of two really cool kids, but they're saying it's half a billion dollars worth of artwork. And ultimately I'm the one who made that decision to buzz them in. It's the kind of thing most people don't have to learn to cope with. It's like doing penance. It's always there.

    Michael: That was Rick Abath, who was a security guard on duty at the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, the night that it was robbed in the biggest art heist in history. He was speaking with his wife, Diana.
      
    Michael: So, Jasmyn, there's a lot to talk about with this story.
    Jasmyn: Absolutely.
    Michael: Let's start with the song that we'ver been hearing, Bob Dylan's "I Shall be Released".
    Jasmyn: Yeh, this is the song that Rick was singing for hours while he was tied up in the basement. And the lyrics are really ironic. And I doubt Rick realized that at the time. But looking back, they're like: "They say everything can be replaced .. so I remember every face of every man who put me here." And then, of course: "Any day now, I shall be released." It's kind of a metaphor for his life. I mean, at the time, he literally wanted to be released from the duct tape and handcuffs in the basement. But this has followed him for the last twenty five years.
    Michael: Yeh, and in a comment on the story, someone brought up Bill Buckner, who in Boston's sports lore is the greatest scapegoat of all time. Because he's the guy who missed the ground ball in the World Series in 1986, which led them to lose that World Series. And that's followed him his entire life. And so this comment said that Rick Abath was the Bill Buckner of the art world.
    Jasmyn: That's kind of perfect.
    Michael: So the robbery happened really early in the morning on March 18, which means the previous day, the day that had just ended was March 17, Saint Patrick's Day.
    Jasmyn: Which is a really rowdy time in Boston. And it's not strange to have a lot of police officers around. So, that's why Rick didn't really think much of it when they showed up at the museum.
    Michael: And what were the rules about opening the door?
    Jasmyn: Well, there was a rule, but I'll let Rick tell you about it.

    Rick: You don't open the door for God, if he knocks. The reality is that we opened the door for anybody, that worked there. People came late all the time. I think the police outranked everyone of those people I had opened up the door for previously.

    Michael: You know, that kind of makes sense to me. If I were a college-age kid working this job, I would have let the police in too. I really empathize with him when he says that he had no idea how to deal with real criminals. I don't think I would either. What sort of training did he have?
    Jasmyn: Actually, Rick said that there really wasn't much training, period. Here he is again.

    Rick: We weren't actually trained, we were shown around. Like, here is the radio. And here is the pepper spray. And there's the panic button. Don't look at that painting at night. Supposedly, it was haunted.

    Jasmyn: So, Rick was obviously a little unprepared to deal with the situation. And one of the tricks that the thieves who were dressed as police officers used was to act like they were suspicious of Rick, which Rick kind of understood, because he didn't exactly fit the description of who you might think would be in charge of protecting millions and millions of dollars worth of art work.

    Rick: You know I had a big Stetson hat on and I had the Isabella Stewart Gardner polyester shirt on, but it was over my Berklee College of Music tie-dye. It was unbuttoned. It was untucked. I don't think I bothered wearing the pants, the polyester pants weren't very comfortable. And I had like purple Guatemalan pants on. So, you knew how it was.

    Michael: And we know what it looked like too, because we're actually looking right now at a Boston police department photo taken of Rick when they discovered him locked up in the basement.
    Jasmyn: Yeh, he's got long hair. He's got a fanny pack on. He really isn't kidding when he describes himself as a hippie dude.
    Michael: And we've posted that police photo on our website, so you can see just what poor Rick went through for those seven hours.
    Michael: So, what has it meant long-term for Rick, to sort of bear this responsibility? Like, what's happened to him over the past twenty-five years because of it?
    Jasmyn: Well, initially Rick was considered a suspect, so the FBI, the local police, they all started interrogating him as soon as they cut him off that electrical box.
    Michael: And it didn't just end that day after the robbery, either. Because they still haven't caught anybody, right?
    Jasmyn: Right. So, Rick has kind of developed this long-term relationship with the FBI. They question him every few years. But Rick has never been charged with anything. And we should say that the statute of limitations is actually up for this crime.
    Michael: Right. Now it's just a recovery effort for the art. And there's a five million dollar reward.
    Jasmyn: Yes. Offered by the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum.
    Michael: So, have you heard from Rick since the story went out over the radio?
    Jasmyn: I have. I got an email from Rick this morning. Turns out he got a message from a complete stranger who heard his story on NPR. And I want to read it to you.

    I didn't look at it like I took somebody's life that really mattered. I looked at it like he was a criminal just like me. I was defending myself. So that's what it was at first. But then my brother, he passed in a penitentiary in Texas--He was murdered by another inmate. And he was 24 hours from his release. 
   
    At first I felt a lot of hate. I broke down because I thought it was karma for what I had done. I kept thinking back about the victim in my case and I thought, Well this guy, you know, he had a daughter. He had a wife and mother. They're going through what I'm going through right now. I'm told that the daughter came to see me once when I was in the county jail. But she just came in to see who I was and I never got a chance to talk to her. 
   
    You know, I think it was drilled into us when we were younger, you're supposed to hate this guy, or hate that guy over there. You just hated him because he was on the other side of the street. I think about that every day. I think about how I could have been different. 
   
    I think the judge, when he sentenced me, he said that when I would be released I would be an old and patient man. And I think I'm accomplishing it.

    Many of the people who came before me were not educated, but they were certainly intelligent. Some of them, you dealt with them several times and the one that comes to mind was Willie Earl "Pip" Dow.

    He would take what was not his in order to finance his drinking problem. You didn't have to try him, he always pled guilty. And he was a likable person. He would write me letters. And he wrote me one time and said, Judge, I feel like I've been up here long enough this time and I would appreciate it if you'd write the parole board and see if they'll let me out. Well, I did and they did.

    And he had been out maybe six weeks when he began drinking and took his friend's watch and the keys to his friend's car. And his friend called the sheriff and told him that he'd been robbed by Willie Earl. But he knew exactly where Willie was, and so the sheriff went there and got him and locked him up. And when he came up before me, of course he pled guilty again. And I got ready to sentence him.

    Come around, Mr. Dow. I am so disappointed I don't know what to say. I have given you another chance and then you got in trouble again, and I just don't understand you.

    Well, he said, well, Judge, I'm disappointed in you. Everything in the courtroom got deathly quiet. He said, when I was here four years ago, you were sitting in that same chair, wearing that same robe, making that same speech. I figured a man of your caliber ought to at least be on the Supreme Court by now.

    Well, I told him, Mr. Dow, I was going to sentence you to five years.  But since you are so perceptive, I think I'll just give you three years, which I did.

    Well, later, when I retired, they had a little ceremony there in the courtroom to hang my portrait. And in walks Willie Earl "Pip" Dow.

    And I told him, Mr. Dow, I am so glad to see you. He said, well, I heard they were going to hang Judge Pigott at the courtroom, and so I didn't want to miss that. I had to ask him, well, I'm resigning; how long is it going to be before you're going back to the penitentiary? He said, Judge, you're resigning? I'm resigning. I'm a retired just like you.

    Well, I asked the judge that replaced me and the sheriff of the county to let me know if he got arrested for anything after that, and he did not. He lived about 10 more years and died a couple of years ago, but he was such a likable person. Sometimes you make friends in strange ways.

    Judge: And the lady is?
    Prosecutor: The peepee. (Laughs) Miriam Brody, Your Honor.
    Public Defender: Sir, Mr Dobbs claims he was merely trying to check Ms Brody's meter, when she, quote, shook her soapy, nude, glistening body at me.
    Woman: This is outrageous. He had his nose pressed up against my window.
    Man: Yeah, well, why don't you tell them what you had pressed up against it.
    Judge: All right, people. What I've got here. I've got no evidence, I've got no corroborating testimony. I don't even have any suggestion of criminal intent. So I would like to write this one off as an unfortunate incident. That is, if Mr Dobbs here can assure the court that he has no past history of unusual sexual behavior.
    Man: My wife's from the old school.
    Judge: And you promise to try to keep your eyes on your job.
    Man: I will do my breast, best.
    Judge: It's all we can ask. Case dismissed.
    Woman: That's it?
    Prosecutor: Yeah, well it was fun while it lasted though, uh?
    Woman: Well I guess it's obvious there's no place for propriety in this day and age. Goodbye.

    Court clerk: Eugene Sleighbough, Attempted burglary.
    Prosecutor: Uh, Your Honor, the People acknowledge the fact there may be a special circumstance where Mr Sleighbough is concerned.
    Judge: Special in what way?
    Defendant: I'm invisible.
    Judge: Who said that?
    Defendant: See what I mean?
    Public Defender: Your Honor, that was my client speaking. He believes that he is invisible to other humans.
    Judge: Is that so, Mr Sleighbough?
    Defendant: You can't see me, can you?
    Judge: Well, certainly I can.
    Defendant: Oh, okay. How many fingers am I holding up? (Rude gesture)
    Judge: There'd better not be just one.
    Prosecutor: It seems as though that Mr Sleighbough tried to take advantage of his condition by robbing a fifth-story Park Avenue apartment in the middle of the afternoon. 
    Defendant: Yeah. It's perfect for me. See, I can slip in and out completely unnoticed.
    Prosecutor: Except for the several hundred people who saw you inching along the ledge.
    Defendant: Ah, that was probably a fluke. See, they probably used some kind of heat-sensing device.
    Prosecutor: Yes. It's called sunlight.
    Public Defender: Your Honor, if I may. It seems to me .. Er, my client is having a little problem with reality. (To defendant.) Don't!
    Judge: Mr Sleighbough, when did you first discover this talent you had to become invisible.

   Court clerk: People versus Doris McKenzie, Your Honor.
   Defendant: Santini Brothers are going to take care of you. They're going to break every bone in your body.
   Wrestler: Please, lady, would you quit hassling me?
   Defendant: Oh, you're going to get plenty when the Santinis get their revenge.
   Judge: All right, ma'am, settle down.
   Wrestler: Is it warm in here, or is it just me?
   Public Defender: You're not alone.
   Prosecutor: You usually don't see something like that without a yoghurt attached, do you? I kid. Ask anybody.
   Judge: What's the story, Mr Prosecutor.
   Prosecutor: The defendant, Mrs, uh, Doris McKenzie was arrested at Madison Square Garden, Your Honor, when she stormed the ring and assaulted ..
   Judge: The Klondike Butcher.
   Prosecutor: Klondike here was engaged in a professional wrestling match when Mrs McKenzie hit him over the head with a folding chair. 
   Promoter: She almost killed him with that thing.
   Wrestler: It hurt like the dickens.
   Promoter: Jack Deleon, Your Honor, promoter. I think this crazy broad should be put away. Look how she scratched up his face.
   Wrestler: It hurt, Jack.
   Promoter: I know, baby, I know.
   Defendant: Why don't you try to do to me what you did to Little Caesar [inaudible], you cheapshot artist.
   Judge: That's enough, Mrs McKenzie.
   Defendant: No, it isn't. This is for Caesar. 
   Bailiff: That's enough. Leave the poor guy alone.
   Wrestler: You're squishing my kidney.
   Bailiff: I'm sorry. Now, you behave yourself.
   Defendant: Muck face.
   Judge: Cut the muck slinging, Mrs McKenzie. That'll be ten days suspended sentence and a fifty-dollar fine.

   Judge: How about if we just get started, huh? First case, Mac.
   Court clerk: People versus the Wheeler family, sir. Bob, June and little Carolyn.
   Man: Just take us right to the gas chamber. We don't care.
   Bailiff: If only they were all like you. (To judge) I like these people. Treat 'em nice.
   Prosecutor: Your Honor, the Wheelers were found on a park bench, crying. They were arrested for vagrancy.
   Woman: For god's sake, help us. Institutionalize us for the rest of our natural lives.
   Public Defender: Your Honor, my clients come from a small town in West Virginia. Two weeks ago, Mr Wheeler lost his job when a tornado leveled the diner he washed dishes at. It also destroyed the adjoining trailer park.
   Woman: Our camper was in Stall 6. It wasn't much. Now, it isn't anything.
   Man: They found one of the axles on a lamp on top of a laundromat in the next county.
   Girl: I lost my doll. We had to dig a collar out of a tree.
   Bailiff: That girl is wearing a potato sack. 
   Bailiff: I know. They always look awful without a belt.
   Prosecutor: Anyway, the real McCoys here. They decided to relocate to Florida. When they were at the Port Authority changing buses, they were mugged. According to the report, they lost everything, their suitcases, their money, their wallets, their clothes, their daughter's cabbage patch .. Oh, come on, you made this up.
   Girl: Will I ever see Disney World now, Daddy? 
   Man: Never, sweetheart. Never in a million years.
   Judge: Recess.
