    Egerton: Speaking of the Southern Historical Association, were you the first black member of it?
    Franklin: That I don't know, John, I really don't know, maybe not. I was the first to be on the program.
    Egerton: Do you know when that was? Was that in Memphis?
    Franklin: No, no, it was in November, 1949 in Williamsburg, in Phi Beta Kappa Hall.
    Egerton: You were on the program?
    Franklin: Yes.
    Egerton: That was the first time a black person had been on the program of the Association?
    Franklin: That's right.
    Egerton: When did you first have membership in it, do you recall?
    Franklin: No, I really don't.
    Egerton: Early, in the '40s?
    Franklin: Yes, I was already a member. I don't remember how far back I went. I always believed, you see, that I ought to belong to my professional organizations. So I did go back to, I would say, the early '40s. If I had the money to join then, I probably did join in the early '40s. Then Vann Woodward came to me in '47 or '48, and he said, "John Hope, if I get to be chairman of the program committee of the Southern and if it meets in a fairly respectable [Laughter] place, would you be on the program?" I said, "Well, yeah." So he became chairman of the program committee, and it was going to meet in Williamsburg which was supposed to be pretty good, you know, [Laughter] better than some places. Then he announced to the program committee what he had done, and they like to have died.
    Egerton: They didn't like this too much.
    Franklin: They didn't like that at all! At all!
    Egerton: but he stuck by it.
    Franklin: "What have you done to us? What have you done to us?" They raised hell, and then it's, you know, "How you going to arragne it?" But all through this long shot song and dance about "Where's he going to stay? Where's he going to eat? Where's he going to be on the platform? Will there be white people? Will he be on a platform that is higher than them, and therefore he'll be talking down to the white people in the audience?" All these things. "Who's going to be on the program with him?" You know, the session where you have two papers. Bell Wiley volunteered to be on the program with me, and Henry Commager volunteered to preside.
    Egerton: So he introduced you?
    Franklin: You couldn't get in that place. It was on the ground floor of Phi Beta Kappa Hall. [Laughter] People even looking in the windows on the side. And it passed without a hitch.
    Egerton: Did you get a good reception?
    Franklin: Got a good reception. Mrs. Lyon Tyler--that's the only question that I can remember--she said, "I don't understand how we can sit here and hear him use the term, Civil War, when he should call it the War Between the States." And everybody broke out laughing. [Laughter] Everybody just laughed at her. You know who she is? Mrs. Lyon Tyler is the daughter-in-law of President John Tyler. She goes back that far. It seems that President John Tyler married when he was real old and had a baby. Then his son married when he was real old and had [a son] Lyon G. Tyler, who later was, I guess, maybe president of William and Mary. One of these very reactionary-type historians anyway.
    Egerton: Lyon?
    Franklin: Lyon G. Tyler, that's a well known name is southern history.
    Egerton: That's outrageous. Well, what did they do about the other things? Where did you stay?
    Franklin: Well, Douglas Adair [inaudible], we had this all fixed up. But Vann let them squirm. He said, "Well, you know, he's very resourceful. He might bring his pup tent and K-rations." [Laughter]
    Egerton: He held their feet to the fire, huh?
    Egerton: You did not attend the banquets?
    Franklin: I don't think I did. I'm sure I didn't.
    Egerton: Gosh, '49, man. Imagine that. God.
    Egerton: You were president in 1970?
    Franklin: I think so. I've been president of all those other major historical societies. I always liked the fact that it was the Southern, the first big organization that named me president.
